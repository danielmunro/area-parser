The South Bridge~
You are standing on a small, rickety bridge leading from the Midgaard
City Dump to the much more attractive promenade of the southern parts of
Midgaard.  You can smell the stench of the dump to the north, the fresher
air of the promenade seems preferable.  Below you are the swift-moving
currents of the Midgaard river.
