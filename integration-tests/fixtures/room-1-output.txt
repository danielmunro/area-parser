A few chairs\nand a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large\nstone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A\nlarge oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with\nwire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.\nHe looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is\nprobably waiting for you to ask him for a room."},{"areaNumber":"0"},{"roomFlags":"D"},{"roomFlags":"S"},{"sectorType":"0"},{"door":"D5"},{"type":"Exit"},{"keyword":""},{"locks":"16384"},{"key":"-1"},{"vnum":"3356"}]]
