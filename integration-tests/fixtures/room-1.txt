The Inn~
You are standing upstairs from Andy's Pub at Andy's Inn.  A few chairs
and a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large
stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with
wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is
probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.
