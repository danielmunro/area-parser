The Bar~
A long mahogany bar is set in the back of the pub.  Mugs line a shelf
behind the bar.  Bottles of strong, nasty looking liquids decorate one
of the lower shelves.  A large cask rests on a table behind the bar.  A
strong but friendly-looking bartender stands next to the cask polishing
glasses.  A couple of the bar maids stand in a corner and throw the most
inviting glances your way.
A sign is on the wall.
