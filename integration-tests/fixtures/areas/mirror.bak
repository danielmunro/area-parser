The Temple of Thalos~
You stand within one of the most holy places in the realm. This stunning 
domed temple houses the city's worshipers en masse. Long benches line the 
aisles and the altar glistens with the gold and platinum inlay.The walls and 
roof are all made of ceramic, making this place reflect the sun well.  
    The greenery around the temple itself makes this place a great blend of
nature and man's works of art.

are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left footprints.
The footprints make a path that looks rather bewildered and is not the kind
of path to lead to anywhere significant or important but it seems to have
made up its mind to enter the hills far away north.  A little distance
further, you lose the trail and decide not to get lost.

leaving You calm and invigorate, ready for the world. Paths lead into the

   Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
   You notice that this building is quite new.  A small plaque is on this wall.
