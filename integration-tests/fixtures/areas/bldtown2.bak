goblet~
A finely crafted silver goblet filled with blood sits on a 
beautifully polished table in the center of the room.
On careful inspection of the goblet you realize this goblet
is the fabled silver goblet stolen from the Yinnish Kaethan King
many years ago! You wonder how Mindweaver acquired it.

A couch made from the skins of dragons is very striking! 
You can see a miltitude of skins magically woven together from 
red, black, green, white and blue dragonskins! The huge overstuffed
pillows are made from very rare and old silver dragonskin. Truely
a remarkable site to see! The couch is a definate showpiece of
a one of a kind workmanship. The story behind acquireing these
skins and the magic blending of them together would make a
fascinating tale!

The Entrance to Town Homes East.~
You have entered Town Homes east.  A canopy of trees form a clearing with
defiant paths leading west east and south.  The entire area has been
preserved from the natural forest it was constructed in; it is clear that the
town home builders decided to go a complete contrast to the city like
aspect of the western town homes and keep the natural forest setting
that is lost in so many other construction projects.

You enter a remarkably beautiful reception room from a door in the
southwest, a marble lion statue guards the entrance.  White marble
walls are adorned by a glowing gold leaf while lants line the east
and west sides of the room, and deep red carpeting pads your footsteps.
The painted domed ceiling depicts a battle between demonic and
angelic creatures and is separated into four groups, by four statues.
A monk on the north side,  berzerker on the east, a samurai on the
south and a sagely wizard on the west.  As the painting rises to the
top of the dome, the battle scene gives way to blue sky and then a
starry darkness to the apex.  At the north end of the Foyer there is
a fountain with a beautiful woman holding out a sword, with a liquid
running down the blade filling the pool around her.

and hanging from the ceiling, pointing down at you like huge spears.
A fissure snakes across the cave floor, and you contemplate trying to jump

eyes start to focus in the dim light, and you see colorful blurs in the icy
walls.
Upon further inspection you realise what your looking at, animals of all
kinds, elk, deer, bears, and a few larger creatures you can't make out.
Everything about this cave sends a chill down your spine.
There is what appears to be a small well in the far corner of the cavern.
A blast of warm air rushes over you as you peer down into the well.
There is a faint red glow at the bottom of the well, but its so far, it
seems miles away...

Taking a deep breath, your lungs fill with a magical water of true

or starlight in a continual array of dancing, bouncing and singing.  A
huge bed sculpted of the innocent light of an autumn day beckons you to
sit and lay on its plush, comfortable surface.  
    A subtle warmth grips your heart, the mystical water
massages your body, and washes your troubles away.  If you listen quietly,
you can hear the beating of the loving heart echo across the rainbow of

Backyard of Crimson and Dalina~
A crystal clear lake with a sandy bottom is surrouned by a forest
of magestic virgin hardwood trees.  The harmony of crickets, birds, and
various woodland creatures singing fills the woods.  
     A small path leads down to a colorful, lush garden full of ripe
apples, oranges, pairs and other exotic fruits and vegetables.
     On the beach, a slight breeze blows a sweet gust of Crimson's love
as a reminder of his eternal love for Dalina.
     A patch of verdant grass offers a solace to lay under the midnight
sky and watch the sparkling lights of a thousand stars dance nimbly about.
In the daylight, it is an elegant place to play, and would be ideal for
the child at heart, or at heart playing with children.
     To the north lies a circle of trees, the sunlight shines
brightly on a single crimson rose, a small drop of rain lays peacefully on
the brim of the most beautiful petal.  If you reach north to touch the
drop of water, you might just fall into its magical kingdom.

In the Shadow of the Mountain~
You are standing in a small valley in the shadow of a mountain.
A great waterfall cascades down the granite cliffs into a deep
pool of dark azure water.  Koi dart amongst the rocks in the shallows
of the pool and small bubbles ocasionally stream up from its' depths.
From the pool, there is smaller waterfall that empties into a large basin
of white marble.
Four jets of water shoot from the sides of the basin in beautiful arcs.
They cross over a large stone gargoyle that is sitting on a raised dias 
in the middle of the fountain.  A deep, soothing voice eminates from this 
guardian when you enter this valley.
It says,  "Welcome friends, to the humble abode of Angella and Boogums...".
No matter where you move, the gargoyles jewelled eyes seem to follow you.
A path has been hewn along the sides of the fountain and pool. The large steps
lead to what appears to be a small grotto behind the torrent of water.

You stand on a large covered porch surrounded by rocking chairs and swings 
swaying gently from the beams above your head. Here the breeze is always 
gentle and summer sweet, filled with the smell of blooming flowers and fresh 
cut grass. You hear a thumping sound, and notice one of Eltanins' hounds 
under a swing, tapping his tail on the porch in welcome of you.  Off the 
back of the porch, a set of steps lead down to the log cabin, which 
Eltanin and BriarRose built entirely by hand, their love infused into every 
joint and boardof the structure.  A long boardwalk leads off the side of the 
porch down to a shimmering lake. where the view of sunsets are incredible.

A horsehoe hangs from over the door for luck.  You walk through the broad
doorway into a large living room.  On your right is a giant stone hearth taking
up most of the wall, and a warm inviting fire blazes in the large fireplace.
In front of the hearth a soft brown bearskin rug covers the stone floor.  To
the right of the fireplace is a set of handmade bookshelves filled with family
pictures and vases of fresh flowers.
Looking over, you notice the trophies from Eltanins' latest hunting expedition
hanging on the wall across from you.  In the center of the room facing the 
fireplace is a large U-shaped sofa.

A slow moving river heads into the tunnel stretching into the darkness.
The water of the river is clear, and the pebbles on the bottom can be seen
distinctly.  Well, there's only a couple things you could do, head back

Wolflord and Taliena's Home~
You have entered Wolflord and Taliena's mountain retreat.  The room exudes
the warmth and hospitality that is basic to their nature from it's glowing
oak walls to the comfortable over-stuffed reading chairs in front of the
fireplace.  Leave your coat on the antique stand by the door.  Relax on the
leather couch or continue through to the kitchen and indoor garden.  A
stairway at the far side of the room leads to Wolf and Tali's bedroom loft.

The Kitchen~
The aroma of fresh-baked bread lingers in this sunlit country kitchen.
Homemade jams and jellies line a shelf on the wall next to a beautiful oak
hutch filled with hand-thrown pottery.  Heavy pots and pans interspersed
with bunches of dried flowers hang from a ceiling rack, and a recessed
window over the sink gives a spectacular view of the lake while allowing
room for Tali to grow her favorite herbs.  An open cookbook titled "101 Ways
with Mushrooms" lies on the kitchen table near a hand-written recipe for
Wolflord's Famous French Toast.  Pull up one of the intricately carved
chairs and sip tea from a sturdy earthenware mug while enjoying a generous
slice of oven-warm bread covered thickly with jam.

Tonak and Emme's Town Home~
You find yourself in a courtyard facing a small country cottage. A 
stream dances over brightly colored rocks and flows beneath a white 
footbridge. Rosebushes for a hedge on either side of the path, 
surrounding you with a heady scent from their full-bodied blossoms. 
The roses continue their climb up the walls of the cottage, small 
tendrils grasping and finding purchase, winding their way through 
the shutters to surround the windows with their simple bauty. The 
urge to rest on the bridge and dangle your toes in the water is 
nearly overwhelming. Go ahead, Tonak and Emme won't mind, but their 
ducks might decide to nibble on your feet.

You have entered the home of Airlana and Anthony.  The first thing that
catches your eye is the beauty of natural wood.  The floors are strip
hardwood.  The open concept consists of a large living room as you enter.
The dining room area consists of a heavy intricatley carved table and six
chairs.  The kitchen area located further back has a small wooden table
for Airlana and Anthony to enjoy their breakfast on.
The windows you see span the entire front of the home...with the trim painted
a deep forest green.
You see exquisite art tastefully decorating the entire first floor.  The large
stone fireplace emits warmth and peacefulness.  To the left you see a large
solid stairwell leading UP to the private sanctuary of Airlana and Anthony.

You stand on a cloud high above Boinga, above you stretches
the vast blackness of space. A thousand pin prick holes poke
through the dark curtain, stars forming the
constelations of Pisces, Leo, Aquarius, Gemini and all the 
symbols of the Zodiac as well as the other constellations. 
Also on the cloud sits the lower end of a great stairway made
completely out of light and lined with stars. It leads up seemingly 
forever and makes you wonder where it could possibly end...

There are two recliners in the room, and a wonderfully carved mahogany

the windows that make up the walls.  But, upon closer inspection you see   
that not every thing is what it appears. Some of the windows are not   
windows, but bricks!  The bricks seem to change color to match the sky.  A   
sense of calm and relaxation comes over you as you hear the melodic sounds   
of the changing skies.  Looking to the north you see a black marble   
billiard table wanting to be played.  On the south wall you see a marble   
lions head which has crystal clear water coming from its mouth.  In the   
center of the room there is an inviting Jacuzzi made from obsidian.

As you enter a simple doorway off Demeter, you find yourself in a whirlwind 
of colors, growing brighter and brighter. You look around in panic, but the 
door behind you has disappeared. Your mind begins to slip away from your 
control as all the chaos in the universe is displayed before you. To the 
west lies the eye of the hurricane, but try as you might, you cannot reach 
it's safety.  As you reach your limit of what you can take, a door opens 
behind you and a path to reality is open once again. You decide not to 
meddle in the lands of Fume again, they were not meant for mortal eyes.

Through the slightly opened paper doors on the far wall, the sunlight

with various flowers and bushes.  On the surface of a small pond in the
middle of the garden, the sunlight dances merrily around the colorful carp

the ground under your feet suddenly separated with a loud "CRACK!" and began
drifting slowly away from the rest of the land...
 
You are now on what appears to be an iceberg, floating in the middle of the
ocean. You can sit back, relax, and let the current take you south, to the
icy continent of Antarctica, or you can try to steer yourself northwards, 
back to Townhomes East. It's a tough choice, but make it quick. It's start-

The Icy Beaches of Antarctica~
You have arrived on the coastline of the chilly continent of Antarctica, 
home of snow, ice... and penguins. You can see some of those loveable 
characters now, waddling around, chatting to each other, and taking dives 
into the icy water. How adorable. As you admire them, you suddenly realize 
how FREEZING it is! Average temperature for this time of year is about -65 
degrees Celsius, so you *might* want to think about getting someplace 
warmer. Looking around a bit, you see it is a beautiful sunny day. If it 
weren't for the climate, you might consider this a good picnic spot. Off 
to the east, you can make out the entrance to a small hovel, sculpted in 
the side of a little icy hill. The black markings above the door appear to
read: "Harry's Habitat." How peculiar. You can stay here and explore this 
beautiful, sunny, COLD continent, or you can go north and wait a little 
while for the next iceberg to break off and take you away from this god-
forsaken rock.

Inside the old Victorian House~
Walking up the stone steps to the verandah of a old Victorian house,
you open the huge oaken double doors and enter the spacious living
room.  The sun shines softly through the deep blue drapes of the
large windows on the far wall illuminating the living area.  To
you right, you see a large open fireplace decorated with exquisite
tiles of colors that emulate burning fire.  Above the mantle of the
fireplace is a large mirror and a small framed poem.  In front of
the fireplace on the polished hardwood floor lies a soft Persian rug.
A deep blue carpet runs up the staircase which climbs around the
cherry-stained walls of the room.  A beautiful chandelier hangs from
the ceiling, its crystals sparling in the morning sun.

poem~
Looking closely at the framed poem, you see that it is written
by Cephas for Stare:
 
Make a Wish
 
Ageless and immortal stone
dwelt in space but never shone.
He was unmoved by pain and death;
eternal life without a breath.
His only price to death defy
was to himself all love deny.
 
But now her heav'nly beauty found
his longing Stare forever bound.
Could he carress a face so fair
and hope of future they may share?
Transfixed upon her eyes so blue
he cared not what was false or true.
Aband'ning was and is to be
he fell into her gravity.
 
A golden thread falling above,
he finally found that light and love
could he in giving all, attain.
His arms spread wide embraced the pain.
 
Brightly burning.
 
Swiftly
 
Perishing.

A Cozy Bedroom~
Cephas and Stare's bedroom is the color of the night.  The shadows
on the cold marble walls seem to dance in the candle light.  In the
middle of the room is a large waterbed covered with silken sheets
and a warm down comforter.  Above the bed, the ceiling is made
completely of glass, making a circular window towards the stars.
Through the glass sliding doors to your left, you see a large
balcony overlooking the faint flicker of torchlight of the city of
New Thalos and the dark shadows of the trees in the enchanted grove.

into the night.  You make a wish.

A Treasure Room~
Piles of gold and silver, gems and jewelry fill this vaulted cavern
within the mountain. Sparkling necklaces, polished goblets, and gem
encrusted weapons and armor are scattered and mixed with the heaps
of coins. The walls and ceiling of the cavern also sparkle and glitter
as thousands of crystals grow in a dizzying pattern.

Ephi's View~
A broad ledge above the treasure chamber makes a perfect spot to rest.
A large opening in the side of the mountain shows you a breath taking view.
From here you can see the other town homes, tiny little boxes scattered
around the small city of Midgaard with its little city walls. Fields and
forests stretch over the landscape as far as you can see, covering the
hills and valleys. Far away, the people of New Thalos and Ofcol look like 
ants. Only the mountains of Olympus and their gods look real, the rest of 
the world seems lost in a dreamy haze. Looking up, a big fluffy cloud the 
shape of a dragon floats lazily around the top of the mountain.

This room contains several shelves filled with books of every kind. A thick

center of this old library, lies a large oak table with maps and plans of
recent areas and battles. A small ball of fire lights the room and hovers
over the table. A mysterious magical aura sends shivers down your spine.

The Great Mound~
You have stumbled onto a huge mound of earth and wonder why you
didn't notice it from a distance.  A perfectly carved set of granite
steps lead up to the crest of the mound where it has been levelled off.
Oddly shaped stones lie along the edge of the crest encircling a small
hut at the center.  White smoke billows out of the cracks of the hut's
mud and twig makeup, but you see no light, nor feel any heat eminating
from it.

It is hard for you to make out anything in this small room.  Beams of
light pierce through cracks in the walls and illuminate the smoke being
made from sticks of incence that hang from the ceiling.  The floor is
covered in red hot coals heated from an unearthly source, but you feel
no pain.  The setting makes you forget about material objects and
worldly desires as you slowly become one with existence itself.

Tree Fort~
You find yourself inside what appears to be a child's tree fort.
The room is octagonal with a window on the north, east, south, and 
west walls.  A large willow tree is growing through the center of
the room, giving support to the floor.  The branches of this
Ancient Tree form a domed roof over the diminutive room, almost
as if by magik.  Many Ancient Runes are carved, burned and etched
onto the trunk and branches of the Tree.  Perhaps they are the
reason this massive deciduous has withstood the weathering of
Father Time so well.
  Shiny Jewels and shimmering Emeralds catch your eyes no matter
which way your head turns.  The gold leafed table, however, seems
uninteresting compared to the extravagently bejewelled hammock that
is strung up between the trunk of the tree and its northern wall.
 
  A trap door in the floor offers you an escape.

Field of Dreams~
As you walk off the main road you find yourself standing at the edge
of a large field of cannabis, the pungent aroma causes your nostrils
to flare.  As you look around you see acres upon acres of cannabis
growing free and wild.  Off to one side a small sign reads "Belevairn's
Property!  Go Away!".  Off to the east you see a small cabin with smoke
billowing out of the chimney.  Along the fence line you see heads jammed
onto the posts.  A stiff penalty must have befallen these adventurers 
who had ventured to close to these fields.

A Dark Secluded Cabin~
As you enter this small dark cabin a very pungent odour enters your
nostrils, more pungent than the odour of the fields surrounding the
cabin.  You locate the source of this odour, finding it to be a 3 foot
long joint laying on the table, still burning.  As you peer through the
smoke filled cabin you see a small comfy bed, a nice padded recliner,
a round card table, and a small fireplace filled with dying embers. 
On the table sits a few cannabis buds and a pack of rolling papers just
begging to be made into a spliff.  All along the walls of the cabin are
weapons hanging from hooks, they are all well shined and oiled, showing
that the owner of this cabin is a true Weaponsmaster.

trinkets resting on it.  You notice you seem to be standing on a rug which
must have taken someone years to make.  Bright colors swirl around its edges
and in its center, a brilliant golden dragon is frozen for eternity,
diving down from high in the sky, perhaps to claim a victim.

In a warm, sunny green house lies peace and serenity. A calm comes over
everybody when they are among the many herbs, flowers, and other plants.
Sanity is brought back to all who think they have lost theirs. One can sit
on the soft earth or on the spacious bench and be one with nature. As one
takes in the tranquility of this space, one can't help but close their eyes
and take a long nap, letting their mind wander and nature rejuvenate their
soul.

You seem to have Traveled a great distant with out moving and find
yourself standing in the middle of a vast desert.  Dunes spread out
all around you in  every direction.  The hot sun beats down on you as it
drains the presious moisture from your body.  Far to the north you see
a large rock formation with what seems to house some sort of Temple.
As you walk along the Dunes, the ground begins to quake and thunder
can be heard in the distance.  Out of the corner of your eyes you see a
monsterous worm rising from under the sand and looks as though it is
heading straight towards you!!  You had better make a run for the
Temple or head back the way you came.  The Worm is Almost upon you!!

surrounds them. As the music fills the ears, a calming sensation fills the
body and one can relinquish the woes of the previous day and rekindle the
mind, body, and spirit for the following day.

Harry's Rec Room~
You have entered into the main room of Harry's habitat;  the rec room.
Despite the cool climate and the walls of ice that support this place,
there is still a certain aura of warmth and friendliness to it.  As you
take a closer look, you are surprised to see all the junk Harry has
lying around.  There are no shelves or bookcases, so he keeps most of it
on the icy floor.  Several confidential PIB folders are scattered
throughout the room, as well as Harry's "Best of Ravenna" record collection,
and leftover buttons and banners from his "Harry for Mayor" campaign.  A
few photographs of his friends line the walls;  you see snapshots of
Boogums, Tonak, Wolflord, Taliena, Pazrael, Nishmael, and many more.  You
notice the absence of a bed in this junk.  You can stay here a while,
grab a soft drink and play a little pinball, or you can venture into 
the other half of Harry's home, to the south.  Of course, there's always
the beach, back to the west.

Antarctica.  The specialized glass that surrounds the room, imported from
New Thalos, absorbs the heat in and traps it there, much like a greenhouse.
Potted plants are placed around the room, giving it an even cozier feel.
There is less junk in here than in the rec room, but items like leftover
HaryldDay wrapping paper and empty boxes of fish fingers still clutter the
floor.  A large jacuzzi sits against the wall, shooting hot water from its
jets.  Gigantic pillows lie on the floor for those who don't enjoy getting
wet.  A huge picture window encompasses the entire south wall, displaying
the majestic splendor of Antarctica.

The Pine Glade~
The pine glade is a place where the mind can be free and the body can relax
from the constant tension of battle.  The ground is soft but crunches
slightly under your feet.  The forest floor is essentially a blanket of dead
pine needles littered over the ground, the result of years of the
magnificent trees shedding their needles.  The golden sun peeks through the
pine boughs that frame the perfectly periwinkle blue sky.  The air is silent
and still.  Occasional shrill but pleasant bird calls break the silence and
echo through the fresh air.  You feel yourself slipping into an almost
heavenly meditative trance as you stand here and witness nature at her
communal best.  Like another plane of existence, a near nirvana, this
ethereal pine glade is a wonderful place to rest and restore your life force.

You step into a seemingly dank and lifeless cavern.
 
Soft and soulful jazz music eminates from the walls. You hear a voice from
somewhere in the dark back of the cave say "Hey baby, come on back here and
I'll show you a good time,".  Taking this unknown voice up on its offer ,
you step cautiously towards its source.  Suddenly a lava lamp lights up and
spreads its groovy light throughout the cave.  The light reveals what looks
like a really nifty bead curtain.  You part the beads and enter the hidden
room. The floor is carpeted with a very hip shag rug.   Sitting temptingly
on a bean bag chair is a youthful and virile looking silver dragon.  He
extends a claw and pulls you down into his lap, tail thumping happily on the
floor.  "Welcome to the Lair o' Love, baby," he says with a devilish grin...

You have entered through an opening in the base of this Giant 
Sequoia tree, and to your surprise you realize that the inside of 
this tree has been hollowed out for someone to live here.  A magical
fountain gushes in the centre of this faintly lit room with cold 
water to quench your thirst.  You are about to take a sip from this 
magical fountain when you catch a glimpse of a black pipe feeding to 
the fountain from the base of the tree.  The magic of this fountain 
is nothing more than stolen irrigation water from the farmer next 
door!  You have a sudden urge to report this blatant theft of water, 
but you hear footsteps approaching from outside the tree. You realize 
the owners are home, and they won't be happy to find you here.  If 
you don't leave now, this will become your permanent resting place.

The Tree Top~
You are at the top of a Giant Sequoia.  You are amazed at just how
high you are from the ground.  This cozy perch allows Dada and
Strife to observe all that is going on below in Boinga and beyond.
Dada and Strife observe all, know all, create all, and ultimately,
destroy all.  This is where DEATH and FAMINE await to bring the
second coming of the Apocalypse.

Emergency Room~
You realize that all those years of eating Oat Bran and Ginseng
to increase your longevity may have been a waste.  There isn't
enough fiber in your diet to save you from a mean old dragon's
breath weapon.  As you pass out from the deep wounds to your head, 
you manage to press the red button on the little device that hangs 
on the chain around your neck, and utter the words, "Help, I've 
fallen and I can't get up!".  You fall to the floor unconscious.  
Help is on the way, and you'll be ready to do battle again.

The Great Willow Tree~
After climbing up the seemingly endless rope ladder, it's a relief
to step onto the large, wooden platform below you.  Glancing up, you
notice that a space of only a few feet separates you from a thick canopy
of leaves.  Peering down, the forest floor appears a tad blurry.  A leaf
falls from overhead, and you watch its long flight down to the earth it
came from.  You realize suddenly that you feel like a part of nature up
here, and that you'd like nothing better than to remain in the
tranquility of this tree indefinitely.  A tree swing moves slowly in the
breeze, beckoning to you from the eastern end of the platform

The Tree Swing~
The wind blows through the tree, causing it to sway and rocking you
gently back and forth as you sit in the swing.  You lift your face up to
the sunshine and smile as the wind plays with your hair.  Somewhere
nearby a robin sings, celebrating the beautiful day, and down beneath
you can see the stream glinting in the sun as it skips merrily along.

Quiggles' Garden~
Stepping down from the tree, you find yourself once again beside the
stream.  All around you green things bloom and the scent of clover is
thick in the air.  You sit down on a mossy bank and idly dangle your
toes in the water, watching a heron nearby and basking in the warm
sunshine.  Behind you are the rows of flowers and herbs lovingly tended
by Quiggles' hand.  Ivy grows over an old stone wall, forming the
northern boundary to the garden.  In the center of the garden, a small
fountain bubbles, covered with wild roses and morning glories.

Nishmael's Cozy Corner~
A tree may be a rather awkward place to find a dwarf, but Nishmael
appears to have made himself at home here.  A small portion of the
massive trunk was apparently eroded by the effects of nature, and now it
forms a perfect hollow to sit against.  Carved carefully, directly above
the eroded spot, is a small inscription that draws your curious eyes.
Seeing as how penguins can't fly or climb, you're startled to see one
perched on a branch, grinning widely at you.  Odd.  Perhaps you should
wander back in the direction of the tree swing . . .

As you walk inside, you see a large hexagonal room about 15 feet high and
30 feet in diameter.  The walls and ceiling seem to be made of a strange metal
that is giving off a soft white light.  There is a recessed circle pattern
spaced out evenly in the walls.  The floor is a glossy black metal that has
no marks in its surface.
Along the far wall there is an odd looking viewscreen.  Faintly in the
background you can hear Beethoven playing.
There are a set of double doors to the south.

You have entered a large room.  Several white pillars support the room
above.  There are a few stone benches surrounding a large beautiful fountain.
The room is alive with green plants of different kinds that are hanging from
the walls and pillars.  The warm moist air is clear and smells sweet to you.
There is a soft white light in the room that appears to come from all around
you.  You can hear a distant humming coming from every direction.
 
As you look around the room you notice a wrought iron spiral staircase leading
up, a large statue of a gold dragon to the east, a glittering silver door to
the south, and a stone archway leading west.  The control room is visible to
the south.

The soft light of the torches reveal a bare dirt floor.
Apparently, this is not the same designer as the entrance room.
A hay bed sets in the north-west corner.
A painting hangs just above the bed.  In the foreground, a older
noble man stands with his long grey hair in a ponytail.
In the background, a large flat roofed fortess looms sliently.
The only other item in the room is a large weapons rack.
It appears only to have swords on it though; Big swords, little swords,
wooden swords, a flaming sword, and three crystal hilts with no blades.
All of these appear to have been used more than once.

half of it on each side.  Even the coffin is make of black and white, just
like the room.  On the left, you can see weapone of destruction and heads
of great beasts displayed as trophies.  On the right, an alter to Matook
rests against the wall.  As you turn to leave, the door shimmers and then
fades from existence.  There does not seem to be anyway out.

here if they like.  Clan rumor has it that the power of the library tends to

A crystal clear lake with a sandy bottom is surrounded by a forest
of majestic virgin hardwood trees.  The harmony of crickets, birds,
and various woodland creatures' singing fills the woods. A small path
leads to a colorful, lush garden full of ripe apples, oranges, pears
and other exotic fruits and vegetables. A patch of verdant grass
offers a solace to lay under the midnight sky and watch the sparkling
lights of a thousand stars dance nimbly about. In the daylight, it is
an elegant place to play, and would be ideal for the child at heart,
or playing with children. A circle of trees, the sunlight shines
brightly on a single crimson rose, a small drop of rain lies peace-
fully on the brim of the most beautiful petal.  If you reach north to
touch the drop of water, you might just fall into its magical kingdom.

Study~
This study is quite unusual, it's more like a Japanese
garden that encompasses the entire room, where curved stone paths make the
room accessible, and a vine coverd glass celing allows light to flow. A
large mossy rock mound in the center of the north wall bubbles over with
spring water, softly cascading into the pond below, which stops in front of
the training circle in the center of the room, and curves around the mound.
You also notice about 10 red and gold koi in the pond, and maybe on black
one.  From the door in the east, one path leads to the training circle and
forks leading to 2 chairs and a desk in the northeast corner.  You realize
that this is where Darkblade concentrates on his deadly skills, the
training circle has many targets, posts, bars and other various objects
used for honing the art of combat.  From the circle two more paths are
accessible, one leads to the northwest corner where a gold and lead yin
yang lies in the center of a groomed rock garden, the other path curves
westward by a number of plants and a stone pagoda that peeks out from the
foliage, and stops at the south wall where a washing basin rests. Despite
the deadly nature of this room it seems quite peaceful, and the calming
nature of the garden puts your mind at ease.

Entryway~
You have stepped into a large, open room with hardwood floors.
A large throw rug, in several shades of blue, covers a large
portion of the room, but stops just short of a set of stairs
leading to a loft overlooking the entryway.  Dozens of pictures
of children in various stages line the walls.

The trees give way to more shadows here, and
the dark gloom of this glade weighs heavily on your soul.
The shadows dance and move with a life of their own, grasping at your
pursestrings and toying with your emotions and judgments.
A break in the trees to the west leads further into this dreary wood,
while a lightly-travelled road lies to the east.

 by the path of time.  If it is still inhabited, it's obvious that the

looking at the room, you notice it is moderately large, and the walls
are circuare circular, as if you were in a giant cylinder.

As you enter this cave tall green plants grow up all around you giving off
a very pungent aroma. light shines in from above giving the plants the light
they need to survive. However judging by the iridescent glow given off by the
plants you have a feeling no sunshine is needed at all for these plants to
grow. in the center of this cave there is a large steel door on the floor
leading even further down. From beneath you can hear the sound of machinery
clanging away aswell is the odd swishing sounds of some sort of liquid being
moved around below you.you are tempted to investigate however the doorway
down seems to be shielded by a magical barrier.oh well might aswell head

of tunes-- from Shakira's "Ojos Asi" to Ross Mitchell's "Dancin' Like
Lovers". A disco ball hangs from the ceiling and colored and strobe
lights are just waiting to be used. A fancy black piano sits in the more
quiet corner for other occasions. Hop onto the plush, red barstool
and rest for a while here.

hand-painted by Luria herself. Images of flowers, oceans, and various

Walking out of the large glass door, you come upon a large balcony of while

some European monarch-- it is difficult to tell with its simplistic,
yet noble beauty. A thick coat of ivy is sprawled over its edge and birds
chirp carelessly among the nearby trees. A stone bench is off to the side,
cool and hard to sit on. A Roman-style statue of a female anthro-cat
stands on the other side.

Apparently you've entered some secret place of hers... the soothing
sounds of water trickle merrily in a thin stream. The brook weaves through
delicate trimmings of various plants and rocks with colorful splashes of
petals here and there. A weeping willow stands in a clearing, the place
where the kitten enjoys sun-bathing and philosophizing. Crickets can
be heard in the bushes and birds sing freely in the air. Fishes of varying
size swim in her stream and tiny frogs sit on the rocks as well. Stone
carvings of pagodas, dragons, and cats line the walkway and
compliment the already aesthetic garden. Nature is in abundance
 here and you are embraced within Her arms.

The walls of this cozy dwelling are made of meticulously crafted
blocks of stone.  Each one fitting with the next perfectly and somehow
gracefully.  They must have come from hills far away.  There are rich
tapestries hiding much of the walls.  Each one depicts some part of the
long and heroic history of the Dwarven people.   You notice a small
table in one corner.  It holds a tiny vase and in the vase a very small 
purple flower.  A calm sweeps over you.

On the wall hangs a quote, "Why worry about the small things in life? There 
are only two things in this world: things you can eat and things you can not
eat."

vibrant-colored umbrellas over each of them. There is a large area of
concrete off to the side for barbecues, basketball games, and other various

Filled with mirrors absolutely everywhere, here the kitten is able to drown

counter and bathroom, and even the ceiling reflect all. The white counter
has two sinks, and in between them sits a tray (yet another mirror) full of
shapely colored bottles. On the other side of the bathroom, there is a little
dresser that she can sit at (mirror!); on the dresser, there is a classic
perfume bottle with a squeezy puffy thing. There is also a shower and
jacuzzi, with plaster hands that stick out of the wall to hold soap and
towels. There is no litterbox, but a regular toilet, in case you are curious
The floor is carpeted in a slight off-white and the room is lit by
fluorescent lights. It's difficult to imagine how many hours a day the
kitten spends grooming here.

You stand in awe of the sheer size of this room.  Stalactites and 
stalagmites have grown together to form vast pillars of stone.  Their 
upper reaches are lost in shadows.  One side of the cave has veins of 
quartz running through it, and sunlight is being reflected through them 
down from the surface.  The sunlight gives the cave an unnatural 
warmth, and most of the moisture has evaporated.  A pool of crystal 
clear water has collected at the base of one of the pillars of stone, 
and what looks like smooth white stones line the bottom.  Further back, 
a natural fissure has opened, but it looks as if the rough edge of the 
rock has been polished.   This looks like the perfect spot to rest.

As you look around, you notice that the walls in here have the same 
smooth finish as the mouth of the fissure above you.  It definitely 
doesn't look natural, though there is some steam rising from vents in 
the rock on the floor some distance away.  Scattered about the room are 
several large scales, and you realize that you have entered the home of 
a very large Silver Dragon.  To the left is an enormous pile of 
treasure!  There are countless diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and 
sapphires scattered through huge piles of gold.  Wicked looking 
weapons, and exotic pieces of armor peek through the treasure in some 
spots.  A well placed mirror reflects the sunlight from above, lighting 
the room nicely.  A pile of junk sits in one corner, and you chuckle 
politely as you remember what a packrat Poon is.

Charlie's Crib~
You stand inside a small square room. The walls on 3 sides
are painted white and textured, while the ceiling and the
frame to the sliding-door closet have a natural wood finish.
The closet is to the north and just to the right of that is a
white door with a mirror mounted in the center of it. The
sliding closet doors are made of mirror with a black-metal
frame, inside there is clothing and a small box marked
"Stash Box - do not open." Next to the east wall is a
comfortable metal-framed futon in the bed position. It is
covered with grey, cotton undersheets, two fluffy pillows
and a dark green comforter. The south wall of this room has
two windows, one is blocked by a large multi-layer Ikea desk.
There is a full tower ATX computer with many fans inside,
filling the room with an ambiant buzzing noise. On the desk
is a monitor, keyboard, mouse and scattered with many CDs and
other items. There are books on the top self of the desk
along with a lava lamp and a CD tower. The western wall has
many posters of videogames and pictures of beautiful models.
There is a large, wooden, metal-framed work bench scattered
with computer cases and parts. The door to the north looks like
the best exit, unless you want to sneak out the window and
down the wall.

Keith's Crib~
The room's distinctive odor tells you that it's keeper has spent
many hours here. The only light source is a 21" Cornerstone
monitor sitting on a false-oak desk, emitting a soft radiant
glow. You have to adjust your eyes to see everything. In front
of the monitor is a keyboard and two mice. Just to the left of
the monitor is a keyboard/mouse switch. Underneath the desk
there are two ATX towers, one to play on and one to run the
network. To the right of the desk, on top of an old, copper TV
tray, there is a large aquarium with a small, red Siamese
fighting fish. The aquarium is marked Pookie's Crib. Pookie
swims out from behind a fake-plant to stare at you, pleading for
a few Betta Bites while moving back and forth to show his
sincerity. A 'Black Panthers' poster on the right wall catches
your eye, the panther appears to be leaping out of the picture,
and another poster to the right of the first one depicts a 9mm
in detail. Sliding closet doors cover the entire left wall of
the room. There is a twin bed in the center of the room, just
to the left of the door, with a dinosaur-print comforter. It
looks tempting, not too firm, and not too soft. Behind the desk
is a large rectangular window with the shades closed to block
out the world beyond. The only exit is south, over the piles of
laundry and through the door you came in from.

The Temple of Huitzilopochtli~
Statues of the winged daemon deity Huitzilopochtli surround this room 
seeming almost lifelike.  At the far edge the room you see two guards.  
Complete with black wings, horns, and long tails, these guards would
do anything to protect the name of Huitzilopochtli.  They notice the 
intruder of this sacred temple and with fangs bared, they take flight
and come after you. You look behind yourself and notice the doors 
have slammed shut leaving you trapped.  With the guards gaining you
have no choice but to look for an alternate exit.  You run franticly around
the room and stumble upon a switch, which opens a secret passage.  
Having no other choice, you walk through.

The Sacrificial Pit~
If you are here, you either entered the wrong room or are the next
sacrifice.  Either way you WILL be the next sacrifice, like it or not.
You see a pile of skeletons in the corner of the room and jars of organs
and blood on the shelves on the wall. You notice a large blood stained
pillar in the center of the room with shackles to hold people in place.
A jeweled dagger is also resting on the edge of this pillar.  You turn 
around to walk out of the room and the large guards grab you by the
shoulders and shackle you to the pillar.  A man in black cloaks walks 
into the room uttering prayers. He grabs the dagger and raises it above 
your chest.  He begins the rapid decent of the dagger to your heart and
you scream...... AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

{RJel{x and {CMeld{x's {GLiving Room{x~
You descend a few steps into a large room, the entire floor, one huge
soft down pillow, enticing you to stop and rest for a while. A dull glow
emanates from a small fire in the fireplace along the south wall of the 
room. The fire itself responds as you enter, flaring up as if to greet 
you. Strange as it may seem, this magical flame burns without heat, yet 
still warms you. Although the windows have no curtains, they shed little
light during the daytime and enhance the light at night. The walls are 
decorated with artworks and tapestries depicting the triumphs of wizards 
in battle. The entire ceiling is {btranslucent{x and glows with an aura 
of magic through which you can faintly see the {Ymagelab{x above.  The 
{btranslucent{x pillar in the centre of the room seems to be the "stair-
case" going up. A large archway leads off to the {mbedroom{x in the west, 
strings of beads draping down from the top of it to the floor. To the 
north you see a door marked {DStoreRoom{x. To the east, a few steps 
lead back out through the magical barrier into the street.

If it weren't for the light filtering through the {btranslucent{x ceiling 
above, this small room would be in total darkness. Even the {btranslucent{x 
staircase built into the north wall of this walk-in cupboard doesn't offer 
much light. Along the walls, all you see are shelves with a variety of 
useless household tools and equipment sparsely scattered on them. The 
staircase leads up from the west to the east, while the door to the south 
leads back into the {Gliving room{x.

{RJel{x and {CMeld{x's {mBedroom{x~
This cosy L shaped room is completely covered with a soft carpet 
that massages your feet as you walk on it. You're not quite sure, 
but it seems as though the room itself is gently rocking, lulling
you off to sleep. The windows here again are uncurtained and control 
the light entering the room.  Built into west wall opposite the beaded
archway leading to the {Gliving room{x is a {btranslucent{x staircase 
leading from the south up towards the north, through the ceiling to the 
{Ymagelab{x. In the south corner are several cupboards, drawers and
tables containing the personal belongings of the inhabitants. In the 
northwestern corner hovering just off the ground lies a huge blanketed 
area. Floating against the wall above it is a small sign reading {RJel{x. 
Just next to it floats a similar, but tiny blanketed area. The sign floating 
above this one reads {CMeld{x. Around the corner in the northeast of the 
room bubbles a drinking fountain of blood.

Great Room~
You enter a very large room. Images of nymphs and gargoyles are
carved into the walnut paneling that covers the walls and ceilings.
In all directions you can see rich tapestries and sculptures 
made of bronze and wood. Some of the tapestries have faded a little,
and some of the sculptures seem to be covered with a fine layer of 
dust. Against the south wall stands a grandfather clock, which 
presents a sharp contrast to the vaguely Byzantine dcor. The 
floor is paved in dark slate and several heavily brocaded rugs
have been scattered about the room in no discernable pattern. 
There is an ancient feel here, as if great deeds, both good and 
evil, were accomplished in this room. The walls seem to whisper 
of orgies, coronations, and executions. To the south you see a 
massive marble staircase with mahogany handrails. It curves upward 
in a great spiral and finally disappears into the shadows above. A 
cloud of incense hangs over the door to the east, and you hear very 
hypnotic music coming from that room.  To the east, you see the glint
of candlelight off of pure silver.

The Lounge~
As you open the door and step into this room, you feel the floor 
sink beneath your weight.  You realize that it isnt the floor, 
but the deep red shag rug you are sinking into.  You notice a few 
people sitting on lightning blue, crushed velvet couches.  On one 
side of the room is a large stone fireplace.  A flame merrily 
dances in its depths.  The room appears to be spinning thanks to 
the oil lamps splashing their rainbow patterns all over the walls.  
Reds, Blues, Greens, and Yellows swim and dance in your vision.  
The sweet smell of incense hits your nose, and almost sends your 
mind reeling.  A smokey haze permeates the room smelling of exotic 
herbs and spices.  Music fills your ears and you almost feel yourself 
swaying to the hypnotic melody.  A peace youve never know comes over 
your body.  You hear snatches of deep, philosophical conversations that 
confound your sense of reality. As you step down into the center of the 
room, a man rises from his seat and greets you.  Welcome to the 
speakeasy, he smiles.  As you take a seat on the couch next to him, 
you feel a sudden and complete enlightenment.

Observation Deck~
You step out onto an observation deck. The platform ends abruptly 
and you seem to hang suspended in the evening sky. The wind feels 
cold but it smells clean and seems to refresh and calm you in some 
strange way. The stars shine steadily with almost no twinkle and 
they cast enough light to see the landscape below. The lonely cry 
of a hunting wolf echoes from the distant forest. A small telescope 
is mounted on an iron pedestal in the center of the platform. It 
seems to be pointing at the North Star.

Sanctuary~
Tall candles burning at an altar that stands against the north wall 
dimly light this room. The floor is a seamless slab of marble. In its 
center, a large circle of the purest silver has been embedded in the 
marble.  Incense hangs heavily in the air, reminding you of roses and 
cedar. On a small table on the east wall, a brass sculpture of a 
falcon (obviously a censer) emits a thin stream of smoke. Near the 
south wall, a small copper dagger hangs in the air, seemingly of its 
own volition. Blue flames leap from the blade. On the west wall, a 
fountain carved from blocks of red ice bubbles quietly. There is an 
expectant feel to the room, as if some solemn ceremony had been 
interrupted and would resume shortly. A curtained door leads back to 
the Great Room.

A small cave for my Beloved to rest~
As you enter the cave on the otherside of the waterfall you notice your 
clothes immediatly dry. Once the initial shock of the sudden dryness has 
settled down you are overtaken by the sheer beauty here. The walls are 
lined with tiny gems of every size, shape, and color. These tiny gems 
reflect back the light from the few torches surrounding the room in a 
dazzling display, that appears as if you have a beautiful night sky 
overhead full of stars twinkling for you and your Beloved. On the lower 
side of the cavern wall you see millions of tiny inscriptions where 
someone has taken, what must have been days or weeks carving the words 
"Mariah, i love you!" over and over again. Just slighly below these you 
see an small carving in much the same style if slightly different 
handwriting "And, Ayden, I love you as well!"

that change colors as you approach them. Wonderful vines that have 
covered most of the walls and ceiling of this inner chamber with a soft 
greenish blue glow blossom tiny yellow flowers. There are shrubs and 
trees of such beauty and splendor that words cannot discribe them 
justly. There seems to be a focal clearing in the center with a

Entrance~
Entering this room, you notice the echoing of the closing door 
behind you.  The elegant clock and the other side of the room
dominates your view, the angles and shapes portrayed drawing 
your eye for a closer look.  Pulling your eyes from the clock 
allows you to notice how dark the room seems, despite the 
crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling.  The dark hardwood 
floor seems to absorb all the light.  A mirrored coat rack lies 
to your right.  Finally you notice the three exits from this room, 
the first is straight ahead seemingly part of the massive clock.  
Unfortunately you can't see past the black mist shrouding the doorway.
A second room to your left seems to be more of an extension of the 
foyer as the dark wood tones dominate the room, however the bookshelves 
lining the walls tell you it's the study.  Through the final passageway 
you can here the sounds of pleasure, a flighty laugh, a deep moan, a
throaty sign, the increased breathing of someone about to ..., a bed 
banging with a steadily increasing rhythm, the (you get the idea by now).  
The sounds draw you near to see where you could join in the fun.

a wooden cross. The cross is stabbed with a Ceremonial Dagger and it bleeds.
The blood flows under the coffin and you notice a misty stairs leading down.

You have entered into a cave like room. There is a balcony where you stand right
now. Blood stream pours down into a lake. The lake is quite big, and it is very 
hard to estimate the diameter. You see candles around it, giving the necessary
lighting for seeing. You notice a fireplace behind the balcony, and as your eyes
get more used into the misty darkness, you notice huge church organs around the 
fireplace. You see spiral stairs leading over the stage. There is the huge lake 
of blood, or at least it seems to be bigger from the shore. Under the balcony is 
the keyboard for the church organs. In front of the blood lake is a huge leather 
couch and a desk. A couple of scrolls and books are lying on the desk. You feel 
quite safe in here although you know that this is a resting place of the vampire.

Mysterious pathway~
It seems you have taken a turn off the main road and find yourself walking
along a mysterious little pathway. Half of the pathway is in dark, black shadow
The trees twisted and malformed and black. No wildlife seems to exist there.
A shiver goes up your back as you feel eyes watching you from that direction.
The other side lifts your heart and brings a smile to your face. The tall
beautiful trees are bathed in sunshine. Birds and squirrels sing and play within
the branches. The thick grass makes you want to relax under their shade.
You feel a strong urge to push forward to see where it leads, and at the same 
time are a little afraid. Is this place good or evil? Do you follow in 
the shadow or the sunlight?

the pathway suddenly opens up to reveal a quaint little cottage right out
the fairytale books.  The grass roof slopes down the sides almost touching
the ground. The sparkling clean windows have flower boxes under them full of
colorful plants. On closer inspection you discover they are not plants but
a wide assortment of strange herbs. A beautiful crystal clear creek runs
along the edge of the property and disappears behind the cottage. You notice
that the yard is also half in deep shadow and half in sunlight.
Puffs of colored smoke come from the chimney and you swear you heard at
least one loud explosion! A hand-carved wooden sign sits above the door.

Compared to the rest of the house this room is kind of messy. A very long table sits in the

Fastest Hunk of Junk in the Galaxy~
You enter the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon.  The pit is somewhat small but can 
easily accomodate 4. Glass surrounds you so that you may see the dangers ahead. Two 
chrome control yokes taunt you for a drive. A pair of metal dice hang in the front.

Living Room of St.Stephen and Dakky~
Odd. Very odd. A youngun dwarf and veteran volare make a very unlikely 
pairing. Their musical thirsts and their desire to help others brought the 
two friends together. Pictures of St.Stephens VW bus sit on an end table. 
Two recliners and an eight-foot long couch offer a place to rest your 
weary feet. Some of Dakkys toys are strewn on the floor. You carefully 
step over Play-Doh containers and Lego pieces as you make your way to the 
middle of the room. To the east you smell something which reminds you of 
your childhood. Through the beads of the west door you see electronic 
equipment and vibrant tie-dyes. And to the south  you hear sweet music 
beckoning you to shake your bones.

Dakkys Play Pen ~
Definitely a child resides here: coloring books lie on the ground, 
Markers, crayons, empty containers of Play-Doh, stuffed animals.
Dwarf inspired weapons line the wall along side Play-Doh
Sculptures of dwagons and faeries. A picture of Dakkys daddy, 
Dakkon, is in a {Ygold{x frame above the doorway. A half made 
Play-Doh figure of the healer at the pit of Mojo rests on a pedistal.
Pictures line the walls and ceiling. A plaque with {YUBERDWARF{x
Scribed on it hangs on the wall above his bed. On his head board, 
the name Dakky is engraved. Maybe he was the eighth dwarf?

St.Stephens Spacey Joint~
Right away you feel at ease when you step into St.Stephens space.  
Various deadhead paraphernalia decorate the room, most notably all 
the tapes, CDs, and videos.  Boxes of em.  There are some 1500 hours 
of Live Dead as well as hundreds of hours of other bands.  This is 
the pad of a true taper.  One of the many {RDark Star Orchestra{x 
shows hes attended and shot video of is playing on the TV.  Nag 
champa incense and a {gsage{x and {ycitrus{x candle add electricity 
to the air.  Christmas-lighted tapestries cover the walls, and 
hacky-sacks the floorboards.  You also spot a signed print of 
Garcias painting Reluctant Dragon and a portrait of Jerry from his 
final tour.  The stereo plays the background music of St.Stephen life: 
folksy ditties, gritty blues, earthy percussion, jazz-rock, and quasar 
jams all seamlessly sewn together.

The Party Garden~
and the joint was jumpin going Round and Round!
{x
You step out the back door and find yourself in what would best be 
described as an open-ended half-room.  The expected walls, floor, 
and ceiling exist near the house but gradually give way to a natural, 
outdoor expanse.  Kind of like a patio, but not so stuffy.  In the 
distance there are trees, hills, wildflowers, and a creek.  This 
pellucid space is where ALL the fun is had. Grateful Dead music 
screams at you right from the walls; St.Stephen had them fitted with 
speakers from THE Wall Of Sound the Dead used back in 73.  Amazing 
lighting rigs are built into the trees, and completely mesmerize 
guests when watching a band play on the stage.  This can be a place 
of meditation, celebration, or INSANE partying, and sometimes, when 
the X-factor is really working, it can be all three at once.

Chanty's Bungalow~
You have entered a small but spacious bungalow.  The walls are
made of rich oak paneling and a beautiful Persian rug only partially
conceals the rowan wood flooring.  Floor to ceiling windows and a beautiful
skylight allow the sun to come streaming in, warming the room naturally.  A
touch of magic permeates this room, keeping everything magically clean and
dust-free.  A plush, brown leather couch dominates the wall opposite a
huge, flat panel television. A steaming Jacuzzi bubbles happily to itself
in a clever floor recess.  Next to the Jacuzzi, a towel rack holds two
full-length towels as well as a selection of bath oils and perfumes.  There
is an oaken door to the east of here, but you are instantly drawn to the
gaming console hooked up to the television.  Now, if only you could choose
a game...

An Impressive Magelab~
This is a very clean and powerful looking Magelab.  The entire
room seems designed to improve your magical abilities.  Shelves and drawers
are installed and filled with magical tools and ingredients.  There is not a
speck of dust in the room, and rather than window lighting, magical globes of
light float near the ceiling, ready to be summoned closer when needed.

The Smoke Room~
As you walk into this room, a sense of Euphoria falls upon you.  You take a
liking to a very familiar smell in the air.  As you gaze around the room,
you notice the walls are made of the Finest Marijuana plants TOWERING over
you more than 18 feet in height.  As you slip deeper into a Euphoric State,
all worries melt away...You look at the far wall and notice two hammocks
, made of hemp from the latest harvest, tied up up among the plants.
You peer a bit closer and see a Massive Handmade shelf that contains
all of Abrams and Chewiks BEAUTIFUL paraphernalia. As you lay down on one of
the hammocks, you reach over to one of the 3-foot glass bongs and start
to wonder.....Why bother ever leaving...

Advanced Magelab~
Upon entering a bleak and dull room, you are struck by the change in the
surroundings, the room is immense!  Ancient Tomes, containers, pipes,
instruments from the bizarre to the mundane fill the shelves from floor to
cealing awaiting their next use.  Large granite tables, heat baths, and a few
furnaces fill most of the floor space.  You become certain the even the most
idiotic fool could produce spectacular results with the equipment
and knowledge contained in this one room.
