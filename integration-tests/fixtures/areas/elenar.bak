The Elenar Forest~
The deeper you tred into the dark forest the more alone you feel,
yet at the same time you feel you are constantly being watched. The
only sounds you can here are the wildlife around you.

Peering through the trees you think you see the faint outline

Intersection in The Elenar Forest~
A decision must be made, deeper and deeper in the woods you go.
Wisely? You do not know. Perhaps treasures it will yield, perhaps
your death by a weapon they wield.
