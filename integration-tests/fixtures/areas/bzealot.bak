An enslaved heritic stands guard here.

This guard lives to defend Zealot.
Legend has it, that all guards within these walls were once mortal enemies 
of the Church, heretics and heathens alike. It was the will of the WLightx 
that they be not banished from existence or converted, rather put to work
within the Tower of the YAlmightyx. They are ready to slay or be slain,
in his name, for only in death might they be forgiven of their sins.
