Homer's Deposition
DOH!  Redferne murdered?  But only last night he signed me an I.O.U.!  
Do you thing I'll ever be able to collect something?  I mean, I can buy 
3 Duffs at Moe's with $10 you know.  Oh, you're working with the police 
eh he, hmm, well, we weren't playing for money *blush* Monopoly! Yeah! 
Monopoly money, and Redferne owes me for landing on my railroad.  Thank 
god he lost, he's such an "in your face" bad winner, especially at 
Monopoly.  What? Oh, suspects.  Well, I dunno. He said last night that 
he'd been receiving some weird phone calls in the past few days.  I 
think he contacted his lawyer asking him for advice on the matter.  
Unfortunately he's out hunting this weekend, so if you want to find him 
you'll have to search a little.  All I know is that he hunts little blue 
things.

Gargamel's Deposition
Yes, I did hear about Redferne's untimely demise.  All I can say is that 
we are looking for his long lost brother.  Turns out Redferne has a 
brother he never knew he had! The guy showed up a coupla months ago and 
befriended Redferne quite easily, too easily perhaps.  Redferne was so 
happy to learn that he had a living relative that he ran to my office to 
change his will and bequeath everything to him.  Unfortunately, the 
clauses of his will are such that only his brother can come forward to 
be identified by the will.  Even I don't know who this brother is until 
he choses to identify himself.  Perhaps you should consult someone in 
the occult business to determine who this brother is.  Madame LaHag who 
lives in the Sea might me able to help you out.

Leo's Deposition
For years the long lost brothers sat apart.  The lost one sat by himself 
for years, knowing of his relative but remaining in the dark.  Finally, 
greed and mischief brought this mighty eye to come out of the abyss and 
leave his forgotten ruins of what used to be a wonderful city to go seek 
fortune at his brother's expense.  Seek ye this creature, beholder of 
the truth, and ye shall find the long lost brother you are looking for.

The Mighty Beholder's Deposition
Oh God! No!  My poor Redferne!  After so many years apart, to be 
separated once more! So soon after! My God! Life is so unfair!  Btw, did 
you catch his lawyer's name?  My god no! Redferne! *snif*  If only I 
hadn't partied with the Lamias all night last night, perhaps I could 
have seen him before this aweful thing happened! *sigh*  You can't think 
it was me!  I have tons of Lamias to prove I was here all evening.

Redferne? Dead?  You're kidding!  Why only last night we were playing 
cards together!  It can't be any of us since we pretty much cleaned him 
out.  None of us had any grudges or anything.  Hmm.. Who might have done 
it?  Gosh I don't know!  Redferne did mention that he had some real 
estate concerns about his residence, something about someone wanting to 
buy his place but nothing that would lead to violence.  Hmmm.. Peraps 
you should ask Redferne's real estate agent.  It's some man with a 
Spanish sounding name in Mega-City One.  That's all I know.

Ernie Ramirez's Deposition
Redferne eh? Well I'll be damned! There goes one of my good clients.  
You understand that I can't tell you anything about his affairs.  
Client-agent you see.  I don't tell anyone, not even my girlfriend, and 
god knows she probes me for gossip.  You know women. I always say more 
than I should.   Have you met her yet?  Isn't she impressive? No, I 
didn't mean the jungle-like appearance, I meant her height at 6ft6.  You 
don't see tall women like that everywhere, hehehe.  Anyways, I got work 
to do and not much to say, so please leave me alone.

The Amazon's Deposition
Hehe, dear dear Ernie.  He'll tell me everything I want to know if I 
know how to ask, and believe me I do *grin*  Anyways,  yeah, I've heard 
Ernie talk about his dealings with Redferne.  Turns out that Redferne 
himself was a real estate agent long ago and that a client of his wanted 
to purchase a large property to erect a castle there.  The deal for the 
land was so good that Redferne double-crossed his client and bought the 
land for himself to build what is now his residence.  I hear that his 
client was very mad and promissed to get back at Redferne for that.  
Hmmm. Maybe you should ask Ernie's attorney, she might be able to help.  
That witch! I'm sure Ernie carries a flame for her *grumble* Anyways, 
follow her songs to the Sea of Serenity.  That's where she hides.

Ernie Ramirez? Yes, he does make use of my services.  His latest 
dealings with me were about a client wishing to have a restraining order 
drawn for a former client.  Let me see the paperwork.  Both parties were 
here just this morning to sign the appropriate papers.  Ah, here it is!   
The restraining order is against a Mr. D. King.  Hmm.  Odd, this person 
simply signed "Drac".  I hope this helps.

enough for me to murder him!  Hmm. Do you think his residence will be 
for sale?  *drool*  Anyways, it just plainly cant be me.

trick he played on you guys?  Oh, beheaded eh? Hmm.. ok.  Well, Redferne 
had many enemies in the gaming community, so I'm not surprised something 
like that happened.  Ya might want to talk to his race track buddy, that 
Greek dude with the wings on his feet.  His name sounds like a sexually

though, so I can't see how come he would do such a thing.  He turned to 
a simple life now, tending to the needs of his master.  He's a servant 
now.  Odd looking guy you know, a minotaur if I remember correctly.  
Anyways, can't be him, he's no longer a book keeper anyways.

Redferne eh?  Owed me money for years that scum bag.  I wrote him off 
years ago in my mind, but when I sold my practice, I traded in his 
I.O.U.s at 10% to the new bookie.  Gosh darn, I'm sure that even at 10% 
I made a profit.  Who is that new bookie? Shoot, I can't tell you that! 
He'd surely have me killed! All I can tell you is that he shoot spores, 
and that if it wasn't for him, the constitution of the people of Boinga 
would be far less than what is presently is.

put one of my best goon on him to recuperate the money he owes me.  Dead 
you say?  My gosh! I hope it's not because of my goon! All I told him 
was to get the money back, nothing about roughing him up or anything.

him, he was alive and well.  Scared and sobbing, but alive and well.  
Hell, I was at the movies all night with Nicole, the Sultan's girl last 
night.  And besides, do you tink I'd ice a guy who owes me money? What 
good would that be?  Now go away before I break your legs.

you gather your senses, you realize that this place over
looks Nova Veesa. Nova Veesa is an odd part of Boinga 
indeed. One creature looks so out of place with the next
and the place seems to glow an eerie purple if you stand
a distance away.

Navy Bay Sports Fields~
Large plains extend to the North. You would not know what these fields 
were for if it weren't for the goal posts still standing erect. Sachmet's 
servants must have played competitive sports on these fields.

The Glory~
You are at the end of the path to glory. It would appear that Sachmet's 
engineers have lured you here to pull you away from the path to Sachmet's 
sarcophagus. You find yourself wondering where you should have turned.

The Tomb of Sachmet~
Your journey is at an end. You have reached the tomb of Princess Sachmet.

place.
