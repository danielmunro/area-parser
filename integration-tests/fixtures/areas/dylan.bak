A fluffy white cloud.~
You find yourself standing on a small cloud.  The cloud feels kind
of spongy beneath your feet.  You find it hard to see anything in
the distance as wisps of cloud blow over your face.

A floating sign says:

"Scubdu's Area--Tread carefully! Only high levels should attempt
this place. Leave messages on the board if you have problems."

crevice and trail you were following.  Below, you can just see the
edge of a cliff through the mist.  There is no trail leading there,
just a smooth, flat, dew-covered rock that almost resembles a
slide ...
