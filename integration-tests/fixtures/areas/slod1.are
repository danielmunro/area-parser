Chapter 3:  Crusaders

3~
They have given us great grieve as they have, instead of pure magic, 
specialized into fighting arts also, which is so brutal. At first
We tried to keep them from leaving into other planes so they wouldn't
lose their perspective to the true power. But as usual, Power and money
is too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into
plane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their
victims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the
most powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they
were to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most
devastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong
against poor living creatures of Boinga.
~
E
2~
We have given possibility to move between the planes to few students
who did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the
the travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their
powers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves
with few armors. To compensate this a little, We have decided to bless
their Weapons with special ability, so they can survive in suffering
world of boinga
~

chapter 1~
{CChapter 1
{x 
From early ages we have found the way to move between planes and found 
new plane where we can create safe institute of learning away from
terror of normal people of Boinga. Our main goal was to build only 
university in this plane where anyone interested in magic and proven
worthy could come and learn to more powerful aspects of magic. Years
went by and we found ourselves sleeping on the floors of class rooms, so
only one conclusion was possible since we were not under hurry to leave
our safe harbor, to build houses for our students.

A jail~
Dark damp room with filth on the ground, this place has the eerie odour of 
death. Small wooden bunk is in one corner of the room and it is really too
small for anyone to sleep on. But at least magicians have given their 
prisoners small taste of freedom, a window on the ceiling to show the red
sky and outside world. But just like in any prison cell, it has been covered
with metal bars.

Blue runes from streets in west blend here into red runes from east
creating magnificent work of art on the ground. Flowers growing from the
piles of ash on the god forsaken ground makes this place perfect for
thinking your past and future. You can feel the power of runes on the
ground relieve your soul from the dark past of yours.
