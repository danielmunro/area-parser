Before you stands a wizened old man.  His shaven head shows a small tatoo of an

enchantments could not hold him though and now he fights for the cause of Robin of

The road to Sherwood {gForest{x~
You stand upon a road that leads to Sherwood {gForest{x.  Off to the West you see
the city of Nottingham.  Beside the road you notice a very large tree with a {rWARNING{x
sign posted by the Prince himself.

At the edge of Sherwood {gForest{x.~
You stand before the edge of Sherwood {gForest{x.  You can see why the merry men
would want to hide in such a place.  The trail before you seems to dissappear into
nothingness.  It occurs to you that if you are not careful then you will surely wonder
from the trail and become lost.

The trail that you have been following splits into three different trails leading in
totally different directions.  You can hear wildlife in the distance.  At least you
hope that it's wildlife and not the legendary ghosts of Sherwood {gForest{x.

Outside the {GMerry{x Men's camp~
The forest that you have been wondering through opens up into a very large clearing.
Makeshift dueling dummies, practice targets and ragged tents are scattered all about.
You never expected the camp of {GMerry{x Men to be like this.  As soon as you step
from the woods you realize that there are two bows pointed right at you.  You had
best watch your step around these men.

raised on the north and south side of the trail giving shelter to the {GMerry{x men.
To the East you can hear the crackling of a large fire.  Just off to the North you
can hear arrows hitting targets at the practice range.  South of here you can hear
the clanging of swords as men practice their fencing skills.  What first appeared to
be chaos now is seen as a well organized training camp.

There is a large fire here in the middle of the camp.  The men gather here at night
to tell stories, eat, drink and be {GMerry{x (men).  The heat from the fire is quite
warming.  There is a large pile of extra fire wood sitting next to the fire pit in
case the fire begins to die down.  The camp trail splits into four different directions
here.  You can see the target range to the north, the jousting fields to the south
and farther to the east you hear the gushing of a river.

their worldly possessions to Prince John and his army of tax collectors.  A lone
cot sits in the corner where a {GMerry{x Man rests his head.  Dreaming of the riches

tools of every sort and fashion are lying about.  Dummies made of straw are erected
in the fields.  Each has hack marks from hours of practice from the {GMerry{x men.
With this much time devoted to swordplay it is no wonder that the {GMerry{x men are
equals to the Nottingham Cityguards.

in the feilds to the North.  To the West you can see the town of Nottingham.  In the
distance just past the fields and the town you can see the Nottingham Castle looming.
None one will be able to sneak up on the camp as long as there is a look out on duty
up here.

In the distance you can see piles of straw with targets drawn upon them.  Most of
the targets have arrows erratically stuck in them.  From the looks of most of the
targets the Sheriff's men are more then safe from the pierce of the {GMerry{x Men's
arrows.  There is a target in the center that tells a different story.  There is an
arrow stuck dead center of the target.  You think of the hundreds of arrows fired
that a single arrow in the bullseye would not be that big of a deal.  The fact the
arrow has been split with another arrow shows that someone around here is quite
possibly the greatest archer in all the land.
 
To the west you can see Ye Olde {GMerry{x Shoppe.  It is the only place in all of
{gSherwood{x to buy all  your supplies for fighting those nasty Notties.  While off
to the east you see a trail that goes farther into {gSherwood{x.

The heart of the {GMerry{x Men's camp is guarded by trees so thick you can hardly see
through them.  There seems to be only one opening large enough to get a wagon
thru and you are standing in that opening.  Straight above your head are two towering
oak trees.  Each have tree stands built on them where {GMerry{x Men sit so they can
sound the alarm if any intruders are coming this way.  Your best chance for sneaking
into the camp is to climb the ladder on the northern tree and kill any guards that
may be watching for you.

The Top of the Ladder~
You are upon the tree stand.  It is amazing to look at the {GMerry{x Camp from here.
There is a large circle of trees so thick that no invading army could get in.  In
fact the opening below you is probably the only opening within the whole circle that
anyone could fit.  You can see the whole layout of the inner camp from here.
 
The large circle has {GMerry{x Men posted throughout, acting as guards.  Within the
circle you see two major paths.  One that runs from North to South, and one that runs
from East to West.  The circle isn't large enough to hold all of the {GMerry{x Men,
but is by far the most secure part of the camp.  If the Nottingham Guards destroy
practice dummies, or archery fields those things can be rebuilt.  This part of the
camp must hold anything that cannot be replaced easily.

Vyldor has marked a page in The Volume of the Realms.  The passage on that page reads
as follows:
 
For one to be safe in another realm is a great task.  One in which the wizards of old
have tried to perform multiple times.  Many died before its perfection.  The secret
as it turns out was taken from two other books, the Tome of Protection and the Book
of Teleportation.  We used the secrets of these two books and combined them within a
magical forge.  This gave us a gemstone that granted us a protection like we had
never experienced before.  The protection of another realm.

Trail Beneath A Watchtower~
You stand beneath a watchtower.  The watchtower is just another measure to ensure
that this is the safest part of the {GMerry{x camp.  You see a trail that goes to the
North and to the East.

A sanctuary between realms~
You feel at peace with yourself as you look around.  You know that only those who
have the same magical powers and abilities as you can get to such a place.  It is as
if you are everywhere in Boinga, yet nowhere at all.  There is a complete nothingness
that surrounds you.  Yet everything is there, just out of reach.  The "walls" of this
room are flashes of places throughout Boinga that you have either seen or heard of.
The Shire, the City of Ofcol, The Planes of Time, the City of Magic.  They are all
there, yet they are all gone at the same time.  Vyldor has outdone himself this is
the perfect place to hide someone from the Nottingham Guards.
