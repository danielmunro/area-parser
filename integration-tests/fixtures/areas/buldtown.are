The Grim Reaper, is here waiting to execute his duty.

The figure stares back at you and all you can see is a skull and where his

turn away but it is hard, as noone looks straight into the face of Death
without paying the consequence - the relieving of the onlooker's soul.

A circle of polished marble, 20 feet in diameter. Around the border,
carved into the walls of the fountain, a series of images seem to come
to life and tell a strangely disjointed tale:
Darkness
Points of light on all sides, yet none of them brightening the surrounding
black.
Floating.
Hopeless.
Suddenly, from out of the darkness, a soft, inviting glow.
Color.
Life.
Not alive, but life just the same.
It is not brought home, but brings home.
Brings home, brings life.
It is the True Crystal, the lifeforce of DogFish.
 
Suddenly, the crystal within the fountain begins to glow more brightly.
You now realise that you are looking upon the True Crystal,
and you find it nearly impossible to break your gaze...

Mandrake, one whose vision never failed him in life.
He lived a long and prospering life, ending short in the life of an
Immortal.  His ideas, though not always feasible, were always unique.
He brought into existance the 'Temple of Elemental Evil' as a level
55 Immortal.  This area, being 200 rooms large, was the largest area
ever created by one so young in his Immortal life.
Other characters he played had great impact.  ShadowCat, once leader of
clan Honor, helped bring about many changes.  Live long, [Hunter].
QuickSilver of clan Balance took in this young Dragon Warrior, and
he became an elite Soldier, when his life was cut short.
 
We the people and Immortal of the world Boinga remember you always.
Through good times, and bad, you stood with all around you, and made
a tremendous impact on our lives.
 
At the very bottom, in very tiny letters, the sign reads:
"To my bestest friend, Mandrake.  I miss you already." -Johnwa

As you approach closer you can see the wood is like nothing you have ever

into this form, the truth is that the wood was sung.  This old art allowed
special people to form wood by their voice, this is one of the best examples

with black.  Eyes so blue its unnerving stare at you, boring into your
soul, forcing you to look away.  A growing feeling of danger invades 
your being, you think it might be best to leave this dragon alone.
 
You peer closer, steeling your nerve against uncertain temperment, and
you notice the scales are fading along the edges, ever so slightly
dulled, tarnished. The rich blackness of the spines are fading into a
deep grey, some not so sharp as they once might have been.  The feeling
of danger is as strong as ever, but it is tempered by a sadness and
weariness that only age can bring.  The pale blue eyes continue to stare
deep into yours, and you wonder how much longer this beast will remain in
this world, and when she will choose to move onwards.

Mandrake's Sanctum Sanctorium~
This room is quite large; built from massive interlocking stones. The high
ceiling is alive with dancing shadows from the room's fireplace, and you
can make out carvings in the huge wooden support beams, which depict the many
scenes of Mandrake's colorful mortal existence.
The fireplace takes up one huge section of the far wall, keeping within
its blackened interior a tame inferno which sends a warmth throughout the
room. A large wooden mantlepiece is set over it, with a set of hooks for
Mandrake's claymore. Various items adorne it, and you think you catch sight
of words carved into a small corner of the wood. You can't be sure, but you
think they say, "Rebecca is the bestest."
Scattered about the room are polished wooden chairs and tables, and wall 
hangings are decorously placed. An enormous desk is in a corner, where the
resident God does his paperwork. The well-padded chairs invite you to rest
your weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can
easily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there
before your eyes.
The carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.
A portrait has been hung over the fireplace.

of History's greatest warriors; such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and
ShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in combat with equally famous
Evildoers like Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, and Elik and Power himself.

~
E
mantlepiece~
The mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to
resist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many
small pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in
his many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and
several small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.
~
E
fireplace~
The fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed
well back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside
sends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,
banishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk
inside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and
releasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in
the flickering dance of the fire.

life-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems
to be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see
enough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late
afternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom
of the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:
"My good friend, Johnwa."
~
E
desk~
The desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same
dark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office
chair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit 
in. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and
quite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled 
daggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung
over one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as
the enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures
under its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures
are actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.
Wait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!
Set on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn
from having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name
printed on the frame...."Rebecca".

the theme of this room is obviously one of practical use, combined with
comfort for a tired warrior after his many journeys.  The walls are done
with fresh-smelling white pine..and through the large, picture window you

Lemik's Porch~
You are standing on a broken down, wooden platform.  Once a beautiful oaken 
design, it now lays in shambles.  To the west is a door, half off it's 
hinges.  In the corner burns a magical light.  Lemik lived here once, but 
you assume he is never coming back.
 
On the front door is a picture with faces of Lemik's friends.

A Darkened Room~
A small room, black and without anything in it.  No lights, no furniture,
no nothing.  The roof overhead seems to be caving in.  There is a trickle of
water forming a puddle on the floor.  You do not feel safe standing here.
 
You can smell the faintness of 'male cooking' to the west.

The smell of big pot pies and chicken wings fill you nose as you walk into
this room. A small table made for two sits in one corner. A counter top
empty and clean and a small icebox barely cover this large room. A few dishes
are left in the sink unwashed. On the table sits a bong and a pack of 
cigarettes. The room feels very lonely.

Atlas' Parlor~
You are welcome to the parlor of Atlas.  You just missed Zeus, Apollo,
and Athena herself.  If you wait a bit, they may return.
There is comfortable leather furniture arranged for conversation around
a bearskin rug and a low, maplewood table.  On the table is a glowing
green-crystal bowl filled with the purest of pure water.
In the flickering light of the fire burning in the grate of the fireplace
you can see that the walls are filled with portraits of the Moosehead
immortals - you identify Rebecca, Talltree, Delstar, and Valnor among
them. You decide to take off your boots, set your feet up by the fire,
and stay awhile.  The room seems to hold powers only the gods themselves
could bestow.

A slight mist covers the moist soil in this spot. Dead trees loom
around you with their withered branches reaching out to obscure your
view of the sky above. Enclosing the cemetery is a rickety old fence
covered by moss and creeping ivy. The bleak surroundings are accented
by a series of tombstones off to the side. In the midst of all this

The lawn itself is a work of art. The grass has been perfectly mowed to a
uniform length, and the overall green cannot be marred by footprints or
otherwise. The tall, surrounding hedges have been pruned and trimmed to
exact measurements, and even the marble bird-bath in the center of the
lawn is spotless. The bush-sculptures themselves are indeed worthy of
examination. Somehow, Mandrake has gotten the bushes to depict, with
incredible realism, scenes of battle that he has witnessed from his home
in the heavens. Can you perhaps see yourself in one of them?

hear the occasional WHAP as a bird flies into the window. Okay. Maybe
it's a little TOO clean.
The window at the back of the house shows a beautiful scene indeed. An
untouched section of forest, with small animals scurrying through the tall
grasses and birds flitting amongst the trees. As an added way of preserving
this small portion of wildlife, Mandrake didn't install a back door.

Standing in this small, dimly lit room, you get an uneasy feeling, almost
as though mystical forces are at work here.  An enormous, wooden desk, 
stands in the north-west corner.  It is very old, and is cluttered with 
papers, pens, scrolls, and a few potion bottles.  A lava lamp sits on the
desk, and illuminates the entire room with an eerie, blue light.   The
eastern and western walls accommodate two massive book shelves.  Along the
southern wall there is a short red couch.  Next to the couch you notice a
little, blue, and yellow pillow that seems to hover two feet off the floor.

Oaken Walkway~
A feeling of calm washes over you, as you step onto a walkway towards the 
yacht.  You can feel the gentle rock of the Midgaard river as it lazily 
passes underneath you. You are standing on a polished oak walkway, 
leading south towards a beautiful boat, and north towards Zeus St.  A 
long, plush red carpet is unrolled here, leading to a gold trimmed silver
door.  An intricate carving of a two dragons, one gold, one silver, 
decorates the door.  On either side of the walkway is a railing, trimmed 
with brushed brass. Small gold, brass, silver, platinum and copper 
figurines of dragons adorn the rail at even intervals.  Strangly, their 
eyes seem to be following you as you move.  At the base of the walkway, 
you see a bronze plaque.  You can board the yacht to the south, and return
to Zeus Street by going north.

The Study~
As you enter the room, the first thing that you notice is an enormous
bookshelf placed against the back well.  It is lined with hundreds of
novels, all varying in size and content.  On the left wall of the room
you see a large portrait of the lovely Lady Sapphire, and also a very
comfortable looking black leather chair.  On the right hand side of the
room is a majestic fireplace, made entirely of marble.  As you approach
the door which enters the Waygate, you feel a slight chill; you wonder
what ist on the other side.

The Waygate~
This room is obviously some kind of waygate between dimensions.  One entire
wall of this otherwise dark room is a large, shimmering pool of liquid
blackness.  The hideously deformed, and often undead creatures of Hell itself
stroll in and out of the waygate, and about the room.  A large, silver 
pentagram is etched into the black marble floor; a green fire burns brightly
within it.  Empty shackles line the room.

Chamber of the Suns~
You step into the spacious living area of the yacht, gently rocking with 
the river's current.  The tall vaulted ceiling and arched doorways to the 
east and west make you feel rather small.  The walls are decorated with 
richly colored frescos, depicting famous battles and events from the 
history of Boinga, as well as dragons, griffins and other creatures of 
many colors.  Hanging on the southern wall is a huge oil painting of two 
dragons, one gold and one silver, their metallic scales shimmering in the 
sunlight.  Two smaller paintings also decorate the same wall.  One of a 
lovely green dragoness, gracefully slaying a wretched creature, perhaps from 
Hell itself.  The other depicts the same dragoness, only at a much 
younger age, who apperes to be trying to teach a small and very cute 
griffin hatchling to hunt rabbits.  The griffin, however, seems to be 
stalking its tail instead. Although sparsely furnished, the room 
contains many statues of dragons, griffins and other beasts.  Some carved 
from marble, others sculpted from precious metals.  You wonder how the yacht
could stay afloat under the weight of such treasures.  On the floor is a 
richly colored oriental rug, decorated with the long snake-like dragons 
of the like you have never seen before.  The owners of this house 
undoubtly have quite an eye for art, and the pieces have been arranged so 
that the light from the small round port holes highlight a different
one as the sun moves across the sky.  Surely you could spend more than a day
in here, admiring the beauty.  To the west you see a large bedroom and to
the east is a deck.

Chamber of the Stars~
A feeling of calm, washes over you again, but this time, your very wounds 
seem to be a faint memory.  Maybe you'll stay here for a while... You are 
in a cool, dry, and sparsely decorated room.  It seems to be a bedroom of 
sorts, although all you see is a HUGE mound of treasure in the middle of  
the room.  Bits of it are scattered around.  A large tapestry hangs on one 
wall, depicting a climatic battle between a blue dragon and a mortally 
wounded silver dragon.  On the southern wall are port holes, and you can 
see the gentle waters of Midgaard river through them.  Light also enters 
the room from above through a skylight set against the vaulted ceiling.  
A very faint smell of roses and sulfur brings your senses together.
To the east lies a living room.

The Grand Entrance Hall~
Walking through the high, vaulted archway and into the entrance hall, you see
before you a tremendous expanse of carved stone. Thick pillars of smooth and
polished marble, as wide as two men abreast, rise over all who pass within
these walls. Suddenly, something catches your attention... it is the sound
of your own footsteps echoed back towards you from above, but a seemingly
impossible distance. Following the pillars with yours eyes, from the floor 
slowly up the gleaming, rounded surface, you discover that they do not in
fact meet the polished stone ceiling that existed in your minds
eye, but dissapears into the inky blackness far, far above your head.
From out of this seemingly irrational emptiness, bright colors begin to
swirl. You turn to look away, feeling you must surely have gone insane,
but you cannot... you will not. Your eyes are drawn into the dancing
light. The colors move down, forcing themselves upon your entire field of
vision and wash over you, taking with them any feelings of fear or 
aggression. You feel happy, secure and peaceful. Suddenly from out of the
darkness above, a deep voice booms:
 
  "Welcome, weary traveller, to the House of Dogfish.
     Stay, while you will in harmony...
      and go your way in peace."

Just perfect for a lazy afternoon of reading or chatting. It would appear
that you've just found all of the noise and bustle that was lost within the
depths of the cavernous entrance hall.
   Not a single person notices your as you stumble into the room, still
somewhat in awe of the sights you have seen in the entrance hall, as well
as weary from the memories of battles fought today. They are entirely too
busy smiling, laughing, playing games, telling stories, and generally
enjoying each others company. Despite the lack of response to your entrance
you know that you are always welcome here, to join in any activities or
conversations that may be going on.

As you enter this room you are quickly and quietly ashured past long rows
of soft beds, occupied by patients of all sorts. Those suffering from
injuries of battle, poison, disease and even few sick and injured animals
watch you as you are led to an empty bed. A priest, his clothing bearing the
symbol or the Order of Dogfish, approaches you and says, "Please feel free
to rest here. The brethren will do what they can to ease any physical
ailments. Stay as long as you'd like and call us if you need anything."
He turns to leave but pauses. Turning towards you with a thoughtful look,
he adds, "and please do not disturb the other patients. Rest well".

Floating within the swirling colors~
Looking up, you clear your mind and slowly float toward the swirling
color above until their soft glow envelops you. Weightless and fearless,
you feel tension slip from your battle-weary and conflicted mind. That
is all in the past, as now there is only the swirling madness about you.
You become less and less aware or your body until you are not entirely
sure that it exists at all outside of your imagination. Suddenly, a spark
of fear, as your mind fights to preserve comfort in the form of continuity
and rationality. Then, through the madness a pure spiritual force slowly
traces the outlines or order. It is the energy of the True Crystal in the 
fountain below you calming your mind and healing your shaken psyche...
soothing... peaceful.

chairs lying about the edge of the pool.  You look over, and in utter 
delight notice the two gorgeous women occupying deck chairs nearby.  The
blond lifts her head a moment, rubs more oil on glistening chest and smiles,
saying, "Have you seen Jakar lately?  I've got something to show him."
The red head nearby chuckles, gently smoothing her hot pink bikini and says,
"He's got nothing on that magicly bablishish Krantzstone."

You stand at the base of a towering silvery-gray mountain, its 
peak hidden by the clouds. As you gaze up its treacherous face, a cold 
chill runs down your spine. You realize someone is watching you. Cold

fire. Subtle movements from shifting shadows leave you wondering whether

and flowing leaving an echo like a strange heartbeat. A faint whisper

it's a little TOO clean.
The window at the back of the house shows a beautiful scene indeed. An
untouched section of forest, with small animals scurrying through the tall
grasses and birds flitting amongst the trees. As an added way of preserving

scant clouds here and there, but the sun in your eyes blind your vision.
A stairwell down here leads to a well stocked gym.

Training Grounds~
You walk into what seems to be a battle.  On the pale, off-white exercise
mat are two men, armed with heron marked blades, dueling.  Their attention 
seems not to fall onto you, rather, they are locked in a deadly gaze with 
one another. Peeling your eyes from the training warriors, you notice just 
how simple this room is. The walls are bare, except for the northern wall, 
which contains a painting. The painting is of a seemingly massive man dueling 
an eyeless being.  What strikes you most about the character in the painting 
are his hard blue eyes and stoney features. A plaque underneath the
painting reads, "Lan al'Mandoragon." Lining the walls are scarred sparring
dummies that have seen the likes of too many sharpened swords.

Amyrlin's Chambers~
A sense of peace overwhelms you as you enter this room.  Fine tapestries hang
along these walls, seemingly contrasting those walls of the previous room.
Fine furniture has been collected from all parts of Boinga and is on display
here.   Paintings also adorn this room, along with fine vases.  Perhaps the
most bewildering sentiment inside the room is that of the Throne that sits
here.  The Amyrlin Seat is placed in the back of the room, resting on a
platform a foot off the ground.  They chair is gilded and crafted so finely
that even the goldworkers of Midgarrd and Thalos would gasp in astonishment.
The women all mill about, their cool, ageless faces seem to look right
through you; not in contempt, rather, in study. You do sit down, and begin to
lose yourself in the tranquility.

Board Room~
This room is decorated lavishly, much like the Amyrlin's Chambers.  On the
walls hang many paintings, there is one of a tall man with tattoos of Dragons
on his arms.  What strikes you most about him are his grey eyes, they seem
distant.  Another is of a massive man with yellow eyes and a wicked axe
hanging on his belt.  The last painting you see another painting of a man
with a low drawn hat and a scarf around his neck.  You notice the massive
scar that the scarf is attempting to hide.  Among all the art work, there is
also a large round table in the middle of the room.  It is made of mahogony
and is so finely kept, that you can catch your reflection in it.  Around the
a table are 7 chairs, each with gilded arms and legs, all ornately carved.
The only light sources in this room are the artificial ones that are
suspended in mid-air, glowing indifferently.

Trophy Room~
It is in here that you see things you never have seen before.  Pictures of
men fighting in the sky.  Bookshelves line the walls with tales of heroism 
you never would have thought possible.  There is even a pen as large
as your forearm, you don't even want to imagine what could hold such an
instrument.  The carpet is made of the finest material, and has just enough
give under your boots, so you feel comfortable.  Aside from the paintings and
the bookshelves, a fireplace roars in the corner, it's gaping maw, like that
of a fierce dragon is big enough for you to walk into without crouching.
Items of wealth are scattered about the room, seemingly unimportant to their
owner.  A statue of solid gold is lying sideways on the ground, while all the
books are neatly kept and dusted as to not wear the pages out.  The
bookshelves shine while the gold does not.  Diamonds lay about the room,
memories of travels far and wide, but seemingly unimportant to thier owner.

A Wide Deck~
This deck seems to be the perfect place to kick back, relax, and catch  
some rays.  A gentle breeze ruffles your hair and hints of the smell of the 
sea, many miles away.  The scenery along the river is beautiful.  The 
river bank is lined with weeping willow trees, whose limp limbs sway in 
the breeze, as well as an abundance of little yellow flowers. Built in 
to the deck is a large swimming pool, filled with clear blue water.  
Several comfortable lounge chairs are arranged around the pool, and 
brightly colored towels hang over the railing, drying out in the sun. Mouth 
watering smells waft through the fresh air from a hot grill, placed
to one side.  A fishing pole hangs hopefully over the side, daring the
underwater inhabitants of Midgaard River to take a bite.  The scene is so 
peaceful, you have never felt so at ease and one with nature as you do 
here, in the warm sun and pleasant breeze; listening to the water quietly
lapping at the sides of the boat.  To the west you can see the spacious
living room.

Cindi and Yogi's Cave~
You hear soft music playing in the background as you step into the cave.
The faint glow cast by the fire in the large stone fireplace on the west
wall and by the numerous candles scattered around the room gives you an
instant feeling of intimacy.  A large pine futon covered with colorful
pillows and blankets dominates the east wall.  In front of the futon, being
used as a coffee table,  stands the hope chest that Cindi's grandfather
made for her.  Along the south wall stretches a long bookcase filled
with cherished mementos and family treasures.  Just standing in the room
makes you feel safe and comfortable.

poem~
From the rise of time, alone I have been,
People I have met, friend I have made,
But trapped within a gregarious person
Was a soul yearning to be found.
 
In a small garden a lovely rose waited to bloom.
Sitting by the flower I discovered her splendor
As she delicately exposed every one of her colors.
Her majestic beauty so easily enslaved me.
 
Day by day my love grew stronger,
Wishing, wanting, needing to be with her.
She has filled my life with such happiness,
I love the person she has made me become.
 
I am no longer alone for my heart has chosen.
Someone for whom my soul will not rest
Until forever with hers it lives united.
My Princess is the one, may she always be mine,
 
Mine until the end of time...

A laminated poem to Cindi is hanging on the wall of the cave, right next to a

while long candles gently illuminate the room.  You hear a faint song playing

Arlundar's Sleeping Chamber~
This room is darker than the others, but you find a torch on a 
stone shelf on the wall. The pitch coating the torch lights 
easily from the spark of your flint. The bright light of your 
torch strangely seems not to illuminate the whole room, 
allowing only enough light to distinguish figures and small 
details in the room. There are many shelfs full of books 
lining the walls, no doubt containing records of the Nosferatu 
and the Dark God that Arlundar serves. There is a large stone 
coffin at the end of the room, and behind that stands a large 
Altar. The coffin is open and you see black velvet lining 
surounding the inside. You realize you are lucky it is night 
out, for if it was day, Arlundar would wake from his sleep and 
make you sorry for intruding into his domain.

Ancient Graveyard~
The rusted gate creaks slowly open, and you quietly enter the graveyard,
as to not disturb any dead which still might here you.  The uncomfortable
feeling of foreboding death and decay is much stronger now, practically 
swamping you with uncontrollable fear.  As you look around at the scattered
grave sites, one in particular catches your eye.  You slowly approach to
read it...but no...it couldn't be...  You turn around quickly towards the
gate, wishing to leave this abode of evil...when you catch a glimpse of 
something in mist, atop the hill to the north.  It appears to be a house,
although you are sure it wasn't there before.  Perhaps your unanswered
questions can be answered there...but for what price?

The utter evil you can feel in this room is practically making you mad.
Sounds of demons and the undead surround you, and shapeless shadows can be
seen moving about.  In the darkness, you can can barely make out a collection
of equipment, although its purpose is yet to be discovered, and you decide
to leave it be...given the horrors you have already experienced.  You 
suddenly notice that the screams are beginning to become louder, and more 
numerous, and that the shadows are venturing nearer.  The door! you think
immediately as you turn to escape...the door which for some reason no
longer exists, as you turn to only a blank wall.  There is no escape...

You are on Zeus Street.  A gigantic ancient tree towers above you, its heavy
twisted limbs hang over the street casting deep shadows.  You shiver from a
temperature drop as you walk under this tree leaving the sun behind you.
A foreboding feeling makes you walk faster, anxious to leave this area.  It
seems even the construction crew for townhomes avoided this area, and made
a wide birth around the tree.  A scratching crawling sound makes you pick up
your pace as a fine silky sticky webbing falls lightly around you.
You look up involuntarily and see a giant web.  In the shadows, a massive
black body clings to the strands.

grasses and birds flitting amongst the trees. As an added way of preserving
this small portion of wildlife, Mandrake didn't install a back door.
Looky-but-no-touchy.

Hera Street~
You're standing on Hera street.  Everywhere you look are neatly trimmed
hedges and happy people going about their buisness.  A janitor whistles
a happy tune as he sweeps the already imaculate cobblestones.
The road continues east to Odin Avenue, or west towards Ra avenue.

Dalayna and Galad's living room~
Luxurious creme-colored carpet stretches out under your feet.  Set within
the north wall is a cozy fireplace, glowing and emanating heat.  Jumping,
crackling flames throw dancing shadows on the walls in a mesmerizing
pattern.  Above the fireplace is a richly-lacquered mahogany mantel.
On it rest several framed photos, including one of Dalayna leaning
against a tree, smiling demurely; another with Dalayna and Galad on
their joyous wedding day; and one with the happy couple embracing on
a beautiful beach in the British Virgin Islands.  Beneath the arched
ceiling, Ansel Adams prints depicting Alaskan peaks and Yosemite forests
adorn the walls.

A tunnel, magically carved from the earth, leads down into the

tingles with magic, an obvious sign of this place being a mage's dwelling.
Water condenses on the rock walls of the cave and collects in small
pools on the ground.  An opening to the east leads into Anthalas' living
quarters, and an opening up serves as Anthalas' exit route from his den.

BlackSunday's loft lies here, strewn with various baubles of gold and other
such moneys.  Diamond piles lie in one corner of this airy abode.  Nearby
to the north, a large cavernous mouth of a cave stands wide open, emitting
the pleasent odors of perfume and oils to waft into the room.  The cave in
the wall seems genuinly like a room, yet upon examination, it is but a false
wall, and while you stand observing, what appears to be a small stone
statuette of a gargoyle shifts it's gaze unto you.  If you didn't know any
better, you might think it was alive.  The shifting calls your attention
to the real exit from this room...an illusionary wall to the east.

covered by bookcases filled with dusty books and jars labelled in a strange
language.  The room has a large four poster bed made from sungwood,  the
wood seems oddly smooth.  A large dining table able to seat twenty in large
comfortably arm chairs occupies the center of the room.  Next to the door
from the staires you notice a weapon and armour rack, on which rest many
different weapons and a set of pitch black armour.  The room is lit by more
then fifty earth tone coloured candels.  The flames of the candels flicker
slightly with a cool breeze that passes through the room, the wind seems
calming almost comfortable.  The one thing that seems out of place in this
romantics bedroom is the noose which hangs from the ceiling in the the

surrounded by tall stately pine trees. Lush mountain greenery and the 
fresh smell of pine invades your senses. A squirrel scampers up a tree and 
you hear the songs of birds. A beautiful waterfall north cascades down to 
a gurgling creek that passes the cabin. Through the trees you can see a

enjoy the peaceful surroundings.  A path leading south curves around the

the pit.  Firelight flashes off the shiny walls and gives the room the
appearance that it is pulsating with life.  Don't get too close to the
sulphuric depths of the chasm... you could fall in.

Headquarters of the A.C.A.C (Anti-Circle Action Committe)~
As you enter, you are overcome by a feeling of pure hatred that seems to be
radiating throughout the room.  The walls are a simple grey, a stark contrast
to the rich tapestries that almost completely cover them.  To one side are
tapestries stolen from the Circle clan depicting the triumphs of the once
powerful and influential guild.  Portraits of great leaders such as Mythorn,
Blackstaff, Salome, Marius, and Handel line the walls as well.  Directly 
opposite are equally rich tapestries showing it's downfall from glory.
Straight in front of you, above a doorway leading to a private chambers is
a picture of a large magical tome with a circle enscribed on it.  A large
red circle encircles the tome along with a diagonal slash straight through it.

The room is dark and musty, with only a thin sliver of light coming through
a single window.  The room is decorated very simply, with no lavish tapestries
and little furniture - a chair, a des, and a bed being the only things.  The
chamber has an air of age and wisdom that is intimidating, even to those of
high ranking.  The walls are lined from floor to ceiling with bookshelves,
most of the books pertaining to the guild of Circle, to wich the owner of
these chambers once belonged.

Foot of the Hill~
You look up the hill and see a glowing tower surrounded by mountains of
snow and ice.  To the north, a sparkling tiara crowns the mountains
peaks.  Bare trees that hang around are covered with sheets of ice.  You
peer intently, and notice they are the only trees around for miles, but
the trees stand tall.  There used to be a free-growing garden just in
front of the tower, but now it's frozen still.  You catch a glimpse of
colour behind the translucent ice, but check again and it's vanished.
The moat around the tower also stands still, silent.  The only thing
that moves is the drawbridge leading inside the tower.  The tower

The black walls of this room tend to give it a sense of being a lot larger
than what it actually is.  A four poster bed sits center against the far
wall, with cluttered sheets covering it.  To each side of the bed, there is
a black marble nightstand.  Each of wich have a strange glowing fiery red
ball floating above it.  Against the east wall, there is a black marble 
dresser with a round mirror perched.  The plush carpet beneath your feet
gives this room a touch of comfort.  To the south-west corner, is a staircase
leading down.  A small black kitten plays with a ball of yarn in the corner.

A small, rough-hewn tunnel winds its way through the rock.  A beam of 
light shines down from above, reflecting and refracting off the gems and 
crystals embedded in the walls and piled on the floor.  A faint rumble 
echos from the south, and you begin to question the wisdom of being at 
the entrance to a dragons lair...

The tunnel widens into a large cave, well lit by many fireplaces that 
circle the cave.  Rough wooden shelves hold bits and pieces of gear 
and tokens of memories from days gone by.  Pictures of family and friends 
adorn the mantles of the fireplaces, and sleeping on the corner of one 
stone shelf is a small black cat, toasty warm from the fire.  The floor 
is covered with heavy rugs and pillows of all sizes, so that anyone of 
any race could sit and be comfortable.  Snuggled in a pile of small 
pillows you spy another black cat, this one looking at you with an evil 
little glare.  The warmth from the fires makes you drowsy, encouraging 
you to sit and rest for a while.

On the walls are pictures of the occupants Biso and Ayla.  One of the

of them fighting Demise, another of from their wedding and another still

The Entrance to a Large Cave~
You stand at the entrance of an enormous cave.  The black steel gates tower
high into the air before you, barring your entrance.  Through the huge
spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.  Large black-
tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that serve as
lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and grey
marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Strangely enough, there
is no furniture in this room.  The walls are tastefully decorated with
weapons and armour of draconian design.  On the far left wall, there is
a display case...filled with the charred ramins of skulls!  Most likely
trophies of past battles.  The ceilings are over one hundred feet high,
and are covered in scenes of dragon battle.  What ever lives here must
be VERY big and draconian.  It would probably not be a good idea to wait
around to see.

the floor with an occasional crunch sending a sickening sound to your ears.
Up above you is a deep dark hole that sends warning signals through your

anxious to get your feet off the floor and your body out from under the

You have entered the shelter of a deep cave.  The air is musty and 
cool; the smell akin to a desert rain.  Water slides off the great 
fangs of rock which adorn the celing, tumbling into clear pools 
excavated within the floor.  A path traverses the cavern from the 
entrance into a darkness which reveals nothing.  Monstrous footprints 
lead directly into that darkness.

Moran's Hole in the Ground~
Crawling though the trash, which seems to consist mainly of dry papers and
chip bags, you come into a crude living space.  It seems to have once been
a averaged sized room, although now it is littered with junk and clothes.
Looking to the north you see silk clothes draped over the top of a divider,
consisting of several outfits ranging from a warm purple color to a soft 
rose.  Glancing to the east, you see the a rather large bar, equipped with
a huge selection of liquors, both straight and pre-mixed; Sex on the beach,
stingers, and pina coladas seem to be the pre-mixed drinks of choice.
  At the far right of the bar, is a fairly decent collection of cigars,
neatly arranged next to a vent so as to not offend any person present with
the odor.  There seems to be a small break in the counter as it continues
to the south, here an assortment of beers has been placed, under guard by
a penguin saying "Doobie doobie do!" and a small honor guard of three frogs
hopping around saying "Bud.." "..weis.." "..er!".
  Boggled, you turn to the west to see an enchanting individual.  Straining
you eyes, you can't seem to make out any details, like some sort of half-
awake dream, yet you know they seem pleasent.  They offer you a seat on the
large bed, and ask if you would like some food.  As they wait on your offer,
you notices a small tube leading down into the darkness, wounder where it 
leads...?

The Chee-to and Cherry Pepsi room~
You are blinded by a sudden light as you slide down the Super Happy Fun
Slide!(tm).  Landing directly into a leather recliner, you await the return
of your vision to see that everything is exactly how you left it.  As you
`recline' in your recliner, `Moon' hops up to you and gives you a big, wet,
puppy kiss.  
  You mull over what to do in your mind..  Civ 2?  Warcraft 2?  Back to
mudding perhaps...  You stare over the 2 VT terminals setup along the
northern wall and wounder where `he' is...

DAMN it's hot in here!  This is a wooden room with benches made of the same.
The air is so hot it gives you breathing troubles until you grow accustomed

There is a T.V. that has been built into the wall in front of the benches for
your viewing pleasure.  All in all, this is a fairly relaxing place.

Magica's entrance to Heaven~
As you enter the domains of what seems a earthly place, the heavens start
to descend down upon you.  Flickering lights dance before your eyes and
Angels start to appear from nowhere.  To the north glows a door leading
to everlasting Peace and Prosperity.  Up, lies the death and despair that
is Midgard, along side with it's dwellers.

The window at the back of the house shows a beautiful scene indeed. An

large loyal golden retriever is curled up in front of the chairs and a
cat walks on the railing surrounding the porch. And old catchers mitt
and baseball lay on the steps awaiting someone to pick them up and play.
A quilt and a book have been discarded on the seat ot the two person
swing. Apparently you have just missed Vivienne and Scorn. Relax and
have a seat. They will return shortly.

A small village~
A small village lies, at the bottom of a small mountain.  Standing on the
outlook of the mountain, you can see nearly everything that is going on
within.  Small farmhouses are spread out, and the town hall is set
somewhere in the middle of it all, along with what looks like a quiet inn,
and a small tavern.  People mill about, and a peddler seems to be selling
his wares; pots and pans, silks, herbs, and the such.  This is the town of
Tyel'Tran, rumored to be the home of the great thief, hero of the people
Tristan.  Perhaps only a rumor, but he has been seen here on multiple
occasions.  Then looking down at the base of the mountain you notice a
small camouflaged house, set into the side of the mountain, it's plain
brown roof and walls conceal it well, blending in with the brush and trees.
There is no apparent way to get to it though, except for a treacherious
climb, up the very face of the mountain.

This room is very large and spacious. There is a fireplace on the wall that 
lights up the entire room. You feel very warm and cozy here. As you rest here, 
a feeling of safety and protection overcomes. It is almost like the Lord of 
Honor is watching over you himself. The room is well decorated with a very 
large central window with curtains. On the floor is a very large fur rug that 
feels nice and warm to lie down on. On the wall, there are paintings of the 
past Lords of Honor, as a tribute to their service and dedication to the clan.
On the main wall, there is a large painting of Mammoth's beautiful wife, Nixy.

High Above Boinga~
From this vantage point a mighty castle is within full view.  It has
four distinct towers at each corner, one of which has grown into
disrepair over time.  The huge steel gate which guards the entrance is
an obvious sign that vistors are not welcome.  The scorch marks from fires
occuring along hte outer walls signify that this castle has been through
many battles, none of which appear to have been successful.  Also, from the
current state of the castle, it looks deserted;  woe to the traveller who
dares venture into a wizard's domain.

The Entrance of the Floating Castle~
This is the mighty stronghold of the wizard Darkrider.  A stench of
evil permeates this room, accented by luxurious tapestries which have seen
better days.  An intricate pattern is engraved upon the cold marble 
centerpiece of this room.  A staff is standing within a hole at each of 
the vertices of the five pointed star.  A stream of light flares down
upon each staff from an opening in the ceiling.  As these streams strike
the crystal skulls upon each of the staves they reflect a beam towards a
central point in the middle of the pentagram.  A large, crumbling
staircase leads up from here into the unknown and a cold draft whips
though the portcullis to the west.

Reception room of Belegar's Tower~
This is a hightly decorated and lavish room.  On the west wall a shield
hangs that visibly radiated both goodness and magic.  On the front of the
shield are two white roses in the form of a St. Andrew's cross upon a field
of blue, the family symbol of Belegar, beneath this shield this has been 
written... `This room is dedicated to those Matookers who helped me rebuild
the Church of Matook when I was given leadership after the departure of 
Fluzel from this realm.  I salute you, Corlath, Blackblade, Lioness, Ruiner,

Ryum and Kirshia's home.~
Your first impression of this room is how dim the lights are, it seems
that the torches are always nearly going out and sometimes flicker.  The walls
are a nice shade of black marble, and the ceiling that of a dull gray.  A
beautiful carpet blankets the floor with rich colors and patterns to give more
of a homely feeling to the place.  Two facing couches made from a strange 
reddish material sit in the center of the room with a brimstone fireplace 
against the wall between them.  There is also a bird cage in the far south
west corner near the doorway, instead of the normal chirping of birds
however, you can hear tiny squeeks of bats as they flutter about inside
it's golden bars.  All along the north wall are the paintings of Escher, one
of Ryum's favourite artists.  Upon a side table next to one of the couches
sit a orange jug of red fluid, it looks strangly delicious.  Other than the
dim lights, lack of mirrors and unusual pets this rooms gives quite a 
comfortable feel.  Looking eastward the light of day appears much too bright
for your eyes, perhaps staying here would be a much better idea.

Ryum and Kirshia's house~
Deeper inside the building lies this chamber, a very snug and lavish 
bedroom filled with pillows.  There is only one light, which hangs from the
center of the ceiling and evenly casts a warm glow about the entire room.  
Several shelves line the walls except the far west, where a giant protrait of
both Kirshia and her beloved husband Ryum.  Since the world is always such a
lound and mysterious place, it is nice to come home, step into this room and
simply fall into the endless piles of comfort.  Flanking the protrait are 
several flower fixtures which have been molded into the rock surface.  A soft
ambiance of music drifts from place to place, always when you want it and it 
never troubles your sleep.  Deep into each of the shadowy corners of this 
room you can barly see two specs of blue light, "The eyes of Guardian
Angels" Ryum calls them, always in wait, making sure nothing bothers your
dreams.

You stand in the middle of an immense black marble room which
has only one exit to the east. At you feet is a large silvery ring
embedded into the stone floor. The only discernable light is a
faint blue glow, emanating from the ceiling itself. The wall to
the left is covered with exotic weaponry from all ages and
styles. The wall to your right is covered with shelf upon shelf
of books, thier titles range from, "Ancient Weaponry:  Their
origin and implementation in society", to "Alron's Anatomical
Index for all races". (Of course you also see an occasional
book of the illustrated female form.) Standing in front of you
is a massive black throne made of black mithril skulls stacked
atop each other. There is a large silvery ring embedded in the
stone to either side of the throne.

The only department in the Boinga Bureau of the FBI is the X-files,
and the X-files consist of two talented individuals, Earendil Mulder,
department head, profiler, brilliant man, and Ghanima Scully, his
trusted partner, forsenic pathologist, and best friend.  The two halves
of the office are like reflections of their owner's personalities.
Earendil's half is in a state of total disarray, case files strewn every
where, half drunk mugs of coffee and ice-tea long forgotten, and 
innumberable sunflower seed husks.  Ghanima's half, on the other hand,
is a model of efficency and neatness.  All of Ghanima's folders are 
neatly filed away, her computer is humming quietly in the background.
You see two pictures, one of Samantha, and one of Melissa.
From this office you can go east or west.

by MIB's that he has stopped worrying about cleaning up after them.
Earendil's TV is quietly playing in a corner of the room to his empty, 
black leather couch.  The couch has a very slept in look and you can't
seem to find a bed anywhere!  The room is awash in sunflower seeds, dirty
laundry, and more.  In another corner of the apartment Mulder's fishtank
burbles happily.  The fish swim contentedly around inside the glass tank.
Near the fish tank are pictures of Earendil's lost sister, Samantha, and
his partner, Ghanima Scully.  On the lone window you see a masking tape
"X" beckoning Earendil's informant to give him information.

You are in a sparsely furnished apartment.  A faint smell of sulphur and

apartment.  Bright sunlight beams through an opening high up on one
wall, it's light focusing on a futon bed.  A white leather couch sits
invitingly off to the side.  Tapestries line the walls, one of them
depicting a silver dragon and a gold dragon soaring through the skies of
southern Midgaard together.  Another depicts a tall warrior, with strange
holy markings, brandishing what looks like a black and slightly curved
blade.  A small display case is in one corner, lit by a floating ball of
light at it's top.  You wonder if Camille is home?

You are in the entrance hall of the spacious home of a powerful warrior.
This is evident from the surroundings, you see racks of many types of
weapons arrayed in niches carved in the living tree, as well as much
battle-scarred armour.
This room is strangely devoid of anything that would identify the owner,
there are no pictures, and the armour and weapons only carry a simple
device of a sword with a very large pommel.
Despite the military trappings the room gives an overwhelming impression
of life, it's almost as if it's watching you.

There is a soft white light in the room that appears to come from all around

In the background, a large flat roofed fortess looms sliently.
The only other item in the room is a large weapons rack.
It appears only to have swords on it though; Big swords, little swords,
wooden swords, a flaming sword, and three crystal hilts with no blades.
All of these appear to have been used more than once.

A River of Silver~
As you drop down onto a small ledge from above, you stop in
wonder.  A river that appears to be pure liquid silver winds its
way through the massive cavern, filling it almost from side to 
side.  The far bank is completely hidden by shadows, nor can you
see where the river begins or ends.  Small ripples break the surface
and you wonder what creatures might live within.

You have entered the house of the Garith family.  A sense of peace washes
over you as you step through the front door; Matook watches over this place
you feel in your mind.  Pictures line the walls... several of the Garith
family, a few of close friends, and one taken by Rage at Nightdagger
and Shalott's wedding.  The entire room is done in cool shades of blue,
and a large fireplace to the east casts a warm glow in the room.  A
large Matookian holy symbol, softly aglow with magic, hangs from the wall
over the fireplace, casting light throughout the room.  Gigantic
overstuffed pillows are scattered all over the floor, inviting you to rest
a spell.  A graceful spiral staircase leads upward to the private
chambers of Nightdagger and Shalott.

You enter a dim gloomy room, as soon as you enter a dark dreary mist
surrounds you.  As you try to peek through the shadow's you see four large
dragons surrounding you, Their eyes seem to glow with a pale red sense,
their faces are magnificantly perfect.  There is no scrach of any, their 
noses seem to flare up as you look into them, the mist has seemed to cleared
but, the lights are almost invisible.  Their body is lined with a brilliant
design of diamonds and opals.  Their claws are long and sharp and seem to
shine through the mist.  Your eyes seem to lower as you try to look through

The base of an ancient oak tree~
You are surprised to find yourself standing before an enormous, ancient
oak tree.  A quiet calm overtakes you, as you feel magical warmth surround
you.  With their love for nature it is fitting that Puck and Tara make this
tree their home.  The canopy that spreads above you allows an amazing amount
of sunlight to warm the ground.  From the south you can hear the musical
chattering of the wood nymphs that once wandered freely in this area.  They
drink from the crystal stream that meanders here.
A large, smooth rock sits between the water's edge and the base of the
old tree.  Friends of Puck and Tara are frequently found resting here on this
sun-warmed rock.  If you look closely you see a ladder of woven vines leading
up the trunk of this fine tree and disappearing into the foliage above you.
You peer upward, but your view is blocked by impenetrable leaves and
branches.

The canopy of an ancient oak tree~
The branches and leaves of this fine tree close around you as you enter,
sheltering you from the outside world.  A small lantern hangs from a central
branch casting a flickering light throughout the treetop.  Peeking into the
lantern you see several tiny, winged faeries.  They willingly lend the warm
glow of their smiles for Puck and Tara's comfort, and watch over the pair as
they sleep.
Tara has fashioned a soft bed woven of grasses and cradled it in a crook
of the tree.  Upon the bed are lambskins for blankets and a mound of unspun
cotton to pillow sleepy heads.  Near the end of the highest branch a cup
shaped leaf sits on a natural platform.  Puck rests here looking out over
Boinga and regaining his strength.
Puck and Tara are often unwilling to leave here, even for a short time,
and hurry back to strengthen their spirits with the peace they find here with
each other.

windows~
As you gaze out the window, you start quite suddenly, as,
without warning, the window winks at you.

comfortable~
A comfortable chair is sitting here, your tired feet beg you to
sit on it.
~
E
shelves~
These shelves are covered in the items known to help
the Circle of Magi.  They are neatly organized and, chances are,
if you need it, it is here.

E
table~
A solidly-built table is sitting here, waiting to be studied at.

Friend and Uraqt's Private Chamber~
A faint smell of incense teases your nose as you enter this room.  You
step onto a soft bearskin rug and look around.  A simple bed lies against
the far wall.  At the foot of it is a sturdy, ironbound chest, most likely
full of Uraqt's trappings from her adventuring days. The room is well-lit 
and absolutely filled with clutter -- enchanting gear, reagents, spell
components, ancient tomes, scrolls, braziers, exotic incense and countless
other tools of the magical trade, all jumbled together with seemingly no 
attention paid to organization.  You have no doubts that Friend can find
whatever he needs without delay, however.

Friend and Uraqt's Mage's Lab~
Elaborate hedges and beautifully sculpted statuary decorate 
the grounds upon which you stand.  The pure white marble is 
woven near seemlessly with the living wood and leaf.  Each 
individual effort was obviously designed through the use of
magic, for no unaided hand could create the works you see 
before you. Ultimately, however, these incredible works of 
art pale before the centerpiece of this courtyard.  A tall 
spire of amethyst soars high into the air eventually reaching
a height of several hundred feet.  Beams of sunlight strike 
this incredible monument, casting off bursts of light and sound.
Occasional bursts of power can be seen flashing out of the tip 
of the crystalline structure.

spire~
This immense spire is truly awe-inspiring.  Surely, this can
only be the work of the most powerful of magics.

leaf~
When you get closer, the leaf flitters away to the hedges.

white~
It seems impossible to focus on the whiteness.

As you try to study it closer, it cringes away.

Stunned by the beauty, you stand here dreaming.

E
hedges~
You see lovely birds and laborious bees flitting around the hedges.

Friend and Uraqt's Storage Room~
You have stumbled upon a massive strong hold.  It is very 
cleverly hidden due to its location.  Huge black impenatrable
walls surround you, as you realize you are all ready in its 
courtyard.  Long vines grow on the exterior helping camoflage 
this room.  You notice no footprints here.  The people whom 
dwell within must be wizards and mages.  At first you do not 
see a way in.  Looking for a pit you notice a large hole in 
the center of the room.  Then at another long gaze you notice 
that there is a rather large gate, one that even the biggest 
dragons could fit through to the north. You wonder how you 
missed it.
