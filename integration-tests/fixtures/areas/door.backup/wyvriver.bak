The trail has ended.  You can go north no longer, the going is just too
rough.  Slightly below you to the east, you can see the river, more
of a stream now.  The cliffs on the far side of the stream are unpassable.
Letting your gaze wander back, you notice notice what looks like a big
deadfall.  Twigs, branches, and even whole trees are piled across the
stream.  
The deadfall is wedged between two high cliffs, a perfect place for a
beaver dam.  Off in the distance, you hear a loud *SLAP* as if something
has hit the water very hard.

At The Dam~
The high cliffs provided the perfect location for a dam.  Trees, some 
three or four hands wide, make up the base of the dam.
The river has been reduced to a small stream.  You then see a small opening
at the base of the dam.  Something is sparkling under the water near
the opening.  The opening is just big enough to crawl through.
To the south, the stream begins to grow in size as more tributaries flow
into it.  To the west, a small trail leads up to the ridge that parallels
the river.

The Ancient Place~
This whole area reeks of Old Magic.  The large altar, the pits where huge
fires would burn, the runes on the altar...yes sir, Old Magic indeed.

The Beautiful View~
WOW! What a view!
To the north and west, you can see the large lake that has formed behind
the dam.  Don't get too close to the edge, that first step is a doosie...

Where the Water Runs Faster~
The water increases it's depth and speed here.  There must be some 
tributary below the surface.  To the east a beautiful arch bridge
can be seen.  A large roar of running water comes from the west.

Top of the Waterfall~
The waterfall is very large and loud.  It is not as pretty as the other
waterfalls in this land, but what it lacks in beauty, it makes up for in
brute force.
You can barely make out some steps that lead down.

Middle of the Waterfall~
Mists from the crashing water below make it very difficult to see around
you.  The rope is tied to a huge iron ring fastened to the wall, a few feet
above your head.  Lucky for you the rope did not break.

Base of the Waterfall~
A great torrent of water cascades down the cliff.  The roar is immense.
An old climbing rope dangles down the cliff face.  You can barely
get close enough to the rock wall to climb the old rope up.

Base of the Dam~
Water water everywhere, and you hope the dam holds.
The north wall is leaking like a sieve, you are standing hip deep in a 
small murky pool.  You see an opening above you.

Oh NO! Part of the roof has COLLAPSED behind you!!!
You figure you had better not try to dig your way out...
This dam is not as sturdy as it looks.

A small pond has formed in this area.  It is about knee
deep.  You think you felt something brush your leg.  Better
be careful.

The Tunnel Turns Up~
The tunnel is dryer here.  You think you see the remains of a fire on 
the floor.  No wonder the animals of the Wood are so disturbed.  
People keep trying to burn down their dam.  A few small bones lie
amongst the sticks.  You think you can see the sky above through
the hole in the ceiling.

Outside Finally!~
You have finally made it out of the dank beaver dam.  It feels so good to
take a breath of fresh air.  The lake extends to the north quite a ways.
You figure the damn must be at least thirty feet high at the middle
and very ricketty indeed.

Angry Beaver Workshop~
This is where the beaver would chop up the wood for his dam.  A large
quantity of poor quality wood lies in a heap.  That could explain the poor 
condition of the dam.
