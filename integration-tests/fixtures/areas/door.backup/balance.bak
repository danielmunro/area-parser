Main Hall of Clan Balance~
At first glance the main hall is smaller than you would expect.  A fire
burns brightly in the corner, and the flickering flames seem to give the 
walls a life of their own.  The ceiling is painted a true black and covered 
with stars that almost seem to glow.  When you look up at it, the room 
seems to expand to infinity.  You feel very safe and peaceful here.
You see a golden glow to the south and a silver glow to the east.

The Vortex Chamber~
The room is made of strong grey stone.  The room is bereft of any
furniture or decoration.  Its only attraction is the swirl of light
that is located in the centre of this chamber.  A strong wind beckons
you to step into the vortex.  Blues, whites, blacks and reds come
together and mix to create the most beatifull golden color that
you have ever seen.  As the colors change, strange colorfull shadows
are cast on the walls in the shapes of Balances and strange arcane
symbols...
  A little plaque is embeded into the ground.
  The Magical Vortex swirls with brilliant colors.

Sir. Balance, we never could have defeated the evil hordes that came
oh so close to swallowing the lands.  
  In order to travel, you must simply think of your destination and
enter the vortex...

there are no fires, yet the room still seems filled with light.  A
feeling of tranquility eminates from an altar at the end of the room where

The Office~
You have entered the Balance clan office.  Looking around you, you realise
the room was designed to be efficent.  A circular table dominates the
middle of the room, allowing everyone who sits at it an equal say when the
clan sits down for dicussion.  Placed in the centre of the table is a
large, golden balance.  Along the Northern wall are the statues of
previous and current leaders of the clan.

gather to chat, talk, and even practice spells when things get dull.
Sit, relax, enjoy yourselef.
