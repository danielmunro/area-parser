Coral Lagoon~
You are standing in a fresh water lagoon bounded by pink coral.  Water and
wind have created fantastic formations out of the sharp coral.  The azure
water looks refreshing and is clear enough to allow you to see thirty feet
down to the bottom.  Near the floor, small fish frolic among the aquatic 
flora.  The sun is a bright yellow in the cloudless blue sky.  Small, white
birds cavort overhead, occaisionally diving deep into the water in a vain 
attempt to snare one of the brightly colored fish of the lagoon.  Bright red
berries and yellow fruit grow in abundance on bushes of various shapes and
sizes that flourish on the beach all the way up to the waters's edge.
Small, furry animals climb playfully in the trees beyond the bushes.  A 
boulder, partially covered with lichen, obscures an unused animal trail to 
the north.

Grand Gates of Tenochtitlan~
You stand in the shadow of a massive stone wall.  Of seemingly solid 
construction, the wall towers more than thirty feet above your head.  A gate
in the form of a large serpent with wings bars the way north.  The belly
of the serpent opens to allow access through the wall.  Dark forms look
down upon you from high above.  A small cave, partially covered by the 
vines of the jungle opens to the west.  An unused animal trail leads into
the jungle to the south.

Jose's Hideout~
Empty bottles of Sauza tequila are strewn about the room.  The distinctive
red star of a Lone Star beer can differentiates it from the rest of the
cans that litter the floor.  The walls are roughly hewn, doubling the size
of the cave.  Green slime grows on the walls beneath water that leaks from
the ceiling.  A flimsy table lies discarded in one corner with two broken 
legs.  A pile of straw in the other corner serves as a bed for the 
inhabitant of this disgusting abode.

The Arena~
You stand in the center of an enormous arena.  The colorful crowd fills the
stands and the air rumbles with their cheers.  It is an honor to play in such
a prestigious game.  You are filled with the certainty of an assured win as
you eye your opponent.  Carvings on the walls catch your attention.  They
picture the decapitation of the winning team.  You quickly lose the game and
attempt to slip out unnoticed in the confusion.  The main entrances are to the
north and south, while the King's private box lies to the east, behind tightly
drawn curtains.

This is where the king views events in the arena.  Two large, wooden thrones
dominate the room.  Pillows are scattered throughout the room for the lesser
nobles.  A portrait of a deeply tanned man covers the entire south wall.  A
wooden railing prevents the king's guests from falling out of the box.  A 
large bronze statue stands in the corner near the arena.  A door to the north,
barred from the other side, provides easy access to the box.

Inside the Walls of Tenochtitlan~
You stand before the fabled village of Tenochtitlan.  Buildings, made 
primarily of clay, sprawl before you.  Two large stone buildings tower above 
the rest.  Lush, verdant fields of corn bound your path, producing all of 
the necessary food for the villagers.  The air is fresh and the people are
happy.  Loud cheers pour forth from a large, stone building to your north.
The sounds of haggling and the cries of vendors erupt from a plaza to the
west.

Crowds bustle around you as you try to force your way through the packed
plaza.  Everything that you can imagine is available here, as well as many
things you have never dreamt of.  Street entertainers attempt to amuse the
busy crowds, while young men stand in the shadows eyeing the purses of the
prosperous merchants.  Occaisionally, the crowds part to allow a noble to
pass through unmolested.  The crowds do this, not out of respect for the
noble, but from fear of the nobles large guards.  The plaza continues to the
north, while a market stall is open to the west and the main gate lies to
your east.

of the carts before purchasing the basic essentials for that nights dinner.
The king's guards patrol the market, keeping the peace, and dealing harshly

socialize and do business.  Small children run around your legs, playing tag.
The din of a market can be heard to the west, and loud cheers come from the
south.  A magnificent palace, heavily guarded, lies to the north.  A large
pyramid sits in the distance, towering above all other buildings in the
village.

flashes with red and blue lights.  A dartboard with a picture of Malderek 
hangs from a nail on a naked wall.  There appears to be no exit from this

Dark Tunnel~
You are standing in a natural tunnel carved out of the limestone over time
by the slowly flowing river that you are currently floating on.  The approach
of your light sends multitudes of tiny, albino creatures scurrying for
cover.

Dead Clearing~
A limestone well enters the heart of the earth.  The ground around the well
is as tough as iron, and barren for thirty feet in all directions.  The 
whole clearing reeks of death.  Two pyramids tower above the forest in the 
distance.

The Grand Shrine of Mystical Voodoo~
This tiny shrine is shrouded in darkness.  Flickering candles provide a
modest amount of light.  Incense burns on an altar against the back wall
of the room.  Two large statues stand guard over a sacrificial vault.

Deepest, Darkest Jungle~
Tall trees tower above your head, forming a thick ceiling of foliage.  
Little light makes its way through the leaves to reach the forest floor.  The
cries of birds, and the screams of jungle cats sound from the thick foliage
above.  You feel the heavy prescence of hidden eyes watching your every move.

Tiger Pit~
You have just impaled yourself on a wooden spike.  You feel your life
slipping away, as you watch your guts slip out of your body.
