Entrance to the Orcs' Lair~
You are at the entrance to the orcs' lair. Revolting odors wafting from the
caves make your stomach retch and you fight to stop from vomiting. Evil
can be felt throughout the entrance. Darkness is all that is ahead in the
caves, the ground is made of solid rock and covered in dirt, fresh
footprints lead off into the darker confines of the lair.

You have decided to brave the lair, how foolish people can be. The smell
gets stronger as you come fully into the lair, where the air has been stale
for a long time. The footprints lead off east. Snoring can be heard coming
from the north, and a small hole leads down into the darkness.

You are inside the orcs' lair. The smell grows stronger as you enter this
room. You fight to keep from becoming ill, while gasping for fresh air.
The footprints seem to have vanished from sight. Straw strewn about
haphazardly covers the floor of this room. Recent blood splatters of a fight
cover the walls. The tunnel continues deeper into the darkness while fresh
air and safety lies on the way out.

the putrid odors come directly from a dark pit below.

You are in the kitchen, where the cook is boiling the slop to feed the 
multitude of hungry soldiers.A few signs hang from the walls with
crude, careful lettering. One reads: Take all you want but eat all you take.
while another reads: This ain't Burger King, you don't get things your way.
You take it my way, or you don't get the stupid food. Obviously whoever
wrote these sayings was not Shakespeare. The pantry is off the kitchen.

the walls in a show of defiance to all those who have dared to enter the

a great orc battle of decades ago. It is quite old and hangs loosely from
pegs pounded into the walls. Whispers can be heard from the south.

Hidden tunnel~
You are in a hidden tunnel. The tunnel seems to have been built very quickly
and is unstable. Constructed of wood and planks it makes you feel rather
unsafe. The ground seems rather soft to the touch and might explain the 
shoring of this passage. Your light has trouble piercing through the gloom
of this room and you hope that combat is not in your plans as the confines
would make combat rather difficult. You notice a few loose boards on top
of you and a familiar smell drifts down from above.

Dead End~
You have reached a dead end. The room is quite large and makes you feel
much safer then the tunnel did. The walls are made of rock and seem quite
solid compared to the softness of the tunnel. Bones scattered all over the
floor create a grisly scene for your eyes to behold. Old rusted and useless
equipment is piled into an orderly fashion in one corner of the room as if
someone lived here. Before you can manage a scream of alarm --

Hyzenthlay's Rabbit Hole~
You stand just inside a very comfortable rabbit hole.  Although built into
the ground beneath you, it seem more than warm and hospitable, rather 
than the expected cold, dank, dreary hole.  From around you, the sounds of
nature call from here and there: a lark, a small owl, even the sounds of
squirrels bedding down for the night.  In the sky, which you can see 
peeking out from the opening of this rabbit hole are the most brilliant
display of stars.  As you look, you almost see then dancing around the
rabbit hole itself; in fact, they look like they are playing, waiting for
the residing rabbit to come join them.  They seem to beckon you to join in
their games.
 
A cool breeze blows softly around you.

Board Room of the Creators~
You stand within the great Board Room of the Creators.  The walls are lined
with tapestries and murals of the great gods of Boinga.  The room is a 
circular wonder, with each ray of light focusing into the center onto a 
golden table where the master Creators gather to meet.
