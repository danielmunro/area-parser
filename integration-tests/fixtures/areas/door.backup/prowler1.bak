The Afterlife~
Your heart beats faster and your skin starts to crawl.  You've
found yourself in a large room with no apparent exit.  The room 
is poorly lit, but you can see the walls alive with activity.  
 
Shadows race across the wall and black mist swirls across the
the floor.  Open mouth faces and small hands seem to be trying to
push towards you through the ceiling.  
 
The mist at your feet starts to rise, before your eyes he appears.

From the top of this tree the view is breathtaking.  To the
north you see a forest rich in color.  A small funnel of smoke
is rising from within the forest, perhaps a campfire.  From one
branch you see a very thin vine, stretched across to the next
tree.  And it looks like theres a pathway at the bottom of that
tree.

A path of sorts is clearly marked, but the overhanging branches
force you to hunch over.  Whoever or whatever uses this path is
obviously not very tall.  You're surrounded by dense bush and can
see little more than ten feet down the path.

Emerald Forest~
The lush plant life and large trees almost block out the sunlight.
Flowers and pine needles cover the forest floor allowing to walk
silently through the forest.  There's barely enough light to see
where you're going.

The Black Market's New Location~
Apparently the local Rangers caught on to the last hideout for
these crooked people.  The Black Market is always talked about
but few people ever really know where to go to find it.  Here it
is.  Not exactly what you expected, but the rarest items around
can often be found here.

Side Of The Escarpment~
You're half way up the side of the escarpment.  The climb turned
out to be a little steeper than you thought at first glance.  A
log about 8ft long lies across your path.  Perhaps a good place to
rest and catch your breath.

The tree tops sway in the breeze, the occaisional pine cone, acorn
or walnut can be heard dropping into the bush beside you.  The path

The Campsite~
The path widens and you find yourself in front of a small hut made
of branches bound together by willow whips.  A shaggy looking
place but it will keep the rain off your head.  A circular firepit
is off to the side of the small hut.  A couple chopped logs seem
to be used as seats for the firepit.
 
The small hut is to the east.

A Ranger's Hut~
Its a small place with the very simplest of furnature.  A small
cot lies against the wall, and there's a small table in the corner
of the room.  The table has a drawer with a brass handle on it.
There's a man sleeping in the cot, perhaps you should leave before
he wakes up.

Deep Within Emerald Forest~
Having travelled for such a long time you turn to see  if
you can see where you've come from.  You realize this dense
forest has disoriented you.  You can't tell where you've been
or how you got here.  Normally this would be a bad thing, but
to be lost on such a beautiful place really doesn't bother
you too much.  You'll find your way out eventually.

all but died.  There isn't even any green leaves on the trees
as far as you can tell.  Something tells you that is not a

The Black Market~
After pulling yourself up on a low hanging branch, you're startled 
at what you've discovered.  A small and very well hidden tree-house
built into the side of the tree itself.  The old door to it has
boards nailed across it to prevent entrance.  There is something
carved into the board.

Secret Tunnel~
You've found a secret tunnel under the Ranger's Hut.  Perhaps the
ranger that owns the hut is in bussiness with the man who runs the
black market.  This would be an ideal way to smuggle things into or
out of the forest without the other ranger's knowing.

A Small Ravine~
The tunnel has led you to a small ravine that runs along side the
forest.  Thick bush lines each side of you, you have no choice but
to follow the rocky path and see where it takes you.  Or, turn back
and forget you've ever been here.
 
To the south you see an entrance to a small tunnel, the ravine continues
to the east.

blowing in the trees russelling leaves is about all you can hear.
To the north there's a narrow path leading deeper into the forest.

Entering The Maze Of Thorns~
Seems to deteer people from finding where this path leads, someone
has created a maze of thorns.  The long branches are full of sharp
needle-like thorns.  Torn, bloody peices of cloths are stuck to some
of the needles.  Sorta makes you wonder what is past this maze that
people are willing injure themselves to get to.
 
As you pull your hands into your sleeves and pull your hood on tight
you realize that maybe this maze isn't to keep people from getting
in...But from getting out.

hack and slash your way through the maze.  The thorns seem to catch
on your armor, ripping and tearing as you try to walk.

The Maze Of Thorns~
Ouch!  The thorned branches sway in the breeze making this even more
painfull that you had expected.  Bloodstained leaves, let you know
you're not the only one that has been pierced and scratched as you
hack and slash your way through the maze.  The thorns seem to catch
on your armor, ripping and tearing as you try to walk.

Lost In The Maze Of Thorns~
Exhausted and delerious from loss of blood, the exits in the maze
fade out of sight.  In a panic you scan the area and all you see
are bushes full of thorns.  They seem to be closing in on you.  To
save your sanity, and your life you decide to retreat.

End Of The Maze~
Collapsing onto the path you breath a sigh of relief.  You've made
it out of that wretched maze.  However as you lay on your back peering
at the tree tops, chills run down your spine and you wish you hadn't
decided to follow the maze.  Skulls of various shapes and sizes are
hung from branches in the trees.  Some with spinalcords still attatched.
Racing to your feet you cringe at the thought of being lost in the
maze of thorns.  Maybe whatever lies ahead won't be too bad.

skulls~
Some of the skulls are cracked, as if smashed with a large mace.
Others although still intact, still have maggots squirming in the
jaw, and eye sockets.  Seems whomever is responsible for putting the
decapitated heads there has found a more civil way of killing.  The
maggots mean that they couldn't have been killed long ago.

Entrance To A Small Village~
The path ends here, with two bamboo stakes complete with mounted skulls
on each side of the entrance.  The village is primative, huts made of
wood and bark, with grass roofs.  Small plumes of smoke can be seen
rising over the huts.  Faint screams in the distance get your attention,
time to make a decision.  Fight or flee.
 
To the east is the center of town.  Seems there's alot of comotion
there, maybe you should take the path to the north or south and avoid
the riot.

A Path In The Village~
The dirt path takes you further into the village, past huts and small
shops.  The village is small, there isn't even anything you would
consider to be a home.  Torches line the side of the path, along with
a few bones here and there.  There's a foul smell in the air and the
smoke from the huts drifts across town preventing you from seeing what
lies ahead.

Center Of The Village~
Bone chilling screams of anguish from a young girl chained to a stake
fall on heartless ears as the crowd chants, screams and spits on her.
For some reason the girl is being burnt at the stake.  A large fire at
the base of the stake with flames 5 feet high have burnt the hair from
her head and is peeling the skin off her naked body.  The crowd is full
of women, how could they be so heartless?
 
This is obviously not a good place to be, maybe this is punishment for
discovering the town.  Either way the only civil thing to do is put
the poor girl out of her misery.  And then RUN LIKE HELL!

Path To Witch's Grove~
A narrow path leading to what looks like a forest of dead trees and
bushes is lined with poison ivy.  The trees, entangled with vines are
smothered in a grey fungus.  There's no sign of animal life at all, not
even any insects walking along the path or across the dead branches
and rotting logs.

A Small Cave~
A large black cauldron bubbles and boils over a small fire.  The
walls of the cave are shelved.  Various odd ingredients line the shelves
none of which are labelled.  There's even a funny looking mouse trapped
in a wire cage.
 
A small cot rests in the corner.
