not right. The tall trees have started looking malevolent, and the
sounds of the birds singing have almost become screams of agony.
The path splits into three here.

seem to have been changed, combined somehow with other creatures in
a most hideous, evil fashion. The answers to these mysterious
changes must be here somewhere.

You approach what seems to be a dead end in the valley. The path
ends at a bridge between the two hills on either side of you, in a
sheer cliff wall. The wall is far too steep to climb successfully.
You contemplate having to turn back through the swamp when you spot
what appears to be a small cave opening near the base of the wall.
It may be possible to force your way through, if you can push a few
rocks out of the way..

inside the hill at this point. Perhaps if you were to circle the

The Gargoyle's Lair~
That's how it can be so loud. This gargoyle is enormous! Despite
the shimmering white light coming from it, you sense its nature is
one of pure evil. It tosses aside the corpse it was munching on,
which seemed to be a cow at some point, and promptly closes on you,
roaring with the anticipation of adding you to its dinner menu.

You find yourself in a claustrophobic, cramped tunnel leading

A Dark Chamber~
The small tunnel opens into a much larger chamber, which can only
have been man-made. This chamber has openings leading to the north,
east, and west, each with a large barricade blocking it. This
chamber also has a guard, suggesting that you may finally be on the
track of whoever is responsible for the mutated creatures you've
encountered.

This passage has a less artificial look to it. Most of this system

movement in the dismal darkness, as well as several passages shaped
into the cavern walls leading to other parts of the cave system.

the power of life and death over the inhabitants of the caves. The
deity's servants are not pleased at your interruption of their
