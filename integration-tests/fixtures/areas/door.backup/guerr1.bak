darken beast~
a darken beast~
A quadripedal creature lurks in the shadows and springs to attack!
~
Aptly named, the darken beasts of Altirin are horridly transformed creatures.
What they may have been before is indiscernable, but they are certainly evil
and hostile now.  The spark in their eye belies an intelligence and cunning
not normally found in wild animals.  The creature walks on all fours, but
often rears on its hand legs to strike with its razor-like talons.  Its
touch is like that of a wraith, draining energy and absorbing it into its 
own black body.  The creature's face resembles a horrible mutated dog, and
its sickly pale skin is visible where the thin clumps of slick, black fur
is missing from past battles.

The sign in written in Yinnish, with a hastily added Common translation,
which was probably not added by the Yinn.
 
It reads:
 
    This is the Altirin Forest, and those who enter, we assume to be of
    sufficient strength to survive the hardships and challenges that lie
    ahead.  Your transportive spells will not function beneath the branches
    of our trees, and no deities offer solace or assistance to their
    devoted who walk in our lands.  You are in the lands of Yaeini.  Survive
    on your own skill, or not.  Our advice: Bring a friend.
 
A note from the creator:
  This area is not really a levelling area.  It is a major challenge in
many ways, most of which you won't discover until it's too late to turn 
back.  Enter at your own risk.  I advise you bring at least a small group
of 51's into this area if you intend to pursue the riches buried in the
heart of the Imperial Palace of dae'Tok.  The treasure is worth the trip.
But be prepared to be challenged.   You've been forewarned.  
                                        -Guerrand

The Altirin Forest~
You stand at the trailhead to a dusty rock path, winding its way into the
intimidating darkness of an ominous forest.  Distant miles to the north,
you can make out a range of craggy mountains reaching skyward.  The forest
crawls about halfway up the mountain range before trickling off into 
splotches of scattered pine trees.

The Altirin Forest~
Darkness clings to your clothing and body as you glance about.  The 
trail pushes northward, but small game trails and tributary paths
through the forest drift off in different directions.  The place
absolutely writhes with life.  You can hear the wind whispering through
the trees, carrying unintelligable voices with it.  Animals scurry
about under the cover of the smaller plants and trees.  Your vision
is completely obscured beyond a few yards by tall, lush, thick pines.

The gravel pathway winds gently to the east here, with a small creek
running alongside.  The creek flows out of the north and meanders off to the
west before vanishing beneath the low canopy of branches and underbrush. 
You can sense as much as hear all manner of animal life around you, some of
it quite close and undoubtedly tracking you.  It may not be a bad idea not
to stand still for any longer than necessary.  The pathway also bends south,
towards a small clearing, apparently a way out of this unnerving wood.

through the undergrowth of the woods towards the south.  To the south, you
can see a loose gravel trail winding through the woods.  The trees are large
and densely packed, and you notice that although the canopy of needles,
leaves, and branches allows precious little light to filter in to the forest
floor, you can see quite well.

You stand near a small pond in the middle of the woods.  Anywhere else,
it would be tranquil.  The water is clear and inviting, and given the myriad
of hoof and claw marks in the clay banks, it must not be bad drinking,
either.  A small stream trickles out from the undergrowth to the west, and
the pond has a small outleast to the east.

air reflects and throws the light into the shadows.  Glancing about, you

Flowing out of the west and bending south, a small creek winds and
twists its way through the woods.  In any other forest, it might be
picturesque.  Here, however, it only makes you wonder when some horrible
beast will crash through the vegetation and attack.  The water is clear and
cool, though appearances don't mean much in a place like this.  A small path
runs off to the north, some kind of animal-made trail.

woods and after collecting in a small pool near a rock outcropping, flows
off to the east.  To the north, you spy a massive boulder, evidently the
source of the water.  To the east, the creek continues to meander through
the woods.  The thick cover of tree limbs overhead lightens slightly here,
and some light actually filters in.  Oddly, it serves only to further accent
the shadows and sense of danger here.

A small creek tumbles down a thick outcropping of brownish rocks in a
loud waterfall to the north, and runs through this small clearing, towards
the south.  Off to the east, you can see a loose gravel trail running
through the forest.  Looking south, the creek meanders around rocks and
trees through the dark Altirin woods.  Somewhere nearby, the trilling call
of some strange bird rises and falls.  
 
There appears to be a cut patch of brambles just behind the waterfall.

Plodding undaunted northward and south, a loose gravel trail works its
way through the forest.  Off the west, a small trail leads to what appears
to be some kind of small brook.  You are quite close to some kind of
mountain range, as the ground is becoming rocky, and inclines steeply as you
move further north.  Occassionally visible through the thick canopy of
branches is the mountainside.  Seeing it closer, you quickly decide that is
is about as threatening as a massive chuck of rock could be.

Bending around from south to east, the heavy gravel trail that snakes
through the Altirin woods cotinues its journey.  You've stumbled out unto
the northern edge of the forest.  The massive cliffs of the mountains loom
up to the north, the rocky, rough bluffs impassable.  A game trail winds up
the side of the mountain off to the northeast, and far to the east, you
notice a massive split in the mountainside.  A pass?

A light game trail leads north away from the main path and runs up the
side of the moutain further to the north.  The main trail leads west and
south from here, the latter direction leading towards the split pass in the
mountain.  The mountains are quite impressively tall, and very dark.  Their
tops are lost in black storm clouds far above, and a rough wind rips at your
clothing, carrying a sense of danger, threatnening.

Although a small game trail leads off to the south, your attention is
caught by the massive split in the mountainside.  It looks as though a
gigantic axe was rended into the mountain range and split it clean in half. 
To the north, the gravel trail leads into the dark pass.  The sides must
tower at least a half-mile into the air on either side.  The forest shies
away from the entrance to the north, as though the proverbial axe slew the
trees as well.

massive range of mountains.

claw and hoof marks of all kinds.  The trail opens up to the south towards a
wide gravel trail.  The trail bends east around a clump of large, dead pine
trees.

is especially close to the trail here, almost uncomfortably soon.  Were

The undergrowth is thick, and you almost feel like you are wading through a
sea of pine needles as you move.

path of least resistance, as the trail winds and twists through the least
tree-intensive areas of the forest.  A very small and almost unseen side
trail leads east-west into what appear to dark thickets of stubby trees and
overgrown flora.

Knee-deep in the Moat~
You stand knee-deep in murky water near the southern shore of the moat.
To south and upward from here, a slippery, muddy trail leads towards the
forests, and north of here lies the keep.  A small storm drain can be 
seen on the other side of the moat, its metal bars rusted away and coated
with slimy moss.  Looking upward, the daunting spires of the palace reach
far into the heavens as if grasping for immortality.

Before the Imperial Palace of dae'Tok~
Before you to the north looms the crimson spires of the Imperial Palace
of dae'Tok.  Flapping banners bear the blue on black symbol of the Yinnish
people, and the palace itself looks more like a fort than the home of an
Emperor.  The massive drawbridge is tucked up against the main gatehouse
protectively, and dark figures can barely be seen keeping watch atop the
battlements.  The dark grey stone is forbidding and almost threatening,
and offers a stark contrast to the bright green of the surrounding forest
lands.  A small muddy trail leads down towards the banks of the moat, 
almost hidden within a copse of thick, twisted vegetation thriving at the
edge of the murky waters.

palace's moat.  Above you, a muddy trail towards the edge of the raised
section of land where the palace drawbridge rests on those rare days when
it is opened.  To the north, you can barely spy a small storm drain half-
buried in the water across the moat.  The cover is covered in slimy moss,
but is appears to be quite rusted.  The trail continues downward to vanish
in the cold waters of the moat.

The Middle of the Moat~
Wading out to the middle of the moat, you distantly sense unseen creatures
playing and writhing around your feet and ankles.  To the south, the forest
looms threatening, accessible by a muddy trail.  Northward, the Palace itself
seems almost comically out of place in the massive forest.  Directly north
from here, you spy a rusty grate covering a storm drain that leads into the
foundation of the palace.  Given that the drawbridge is up, this is probably
the only way in.

The north bank of the moat~
You stand waist-deep in murky moat water on the north end of the moat.  The
waters lap up against the slime-covered stone of the palace foundation.  The
impressive structure seems immeasurably high from your vantage point.  South
of this point lies the moat, and on the opposite bank a muddy trail leads
upwards towards the North Altirin forest.  North of here, a storm drain is
half-buried in the water.  You can spy a pool of water on the other side
lapping up against some kind of jagged rocky shore within the bowels of the
palace.

looms several yards over you.  To the south, a round storm drain allows the
water to flow into the palace at this point, though what use this drain 
serves, one can't imagine.

Next to a pool in the foundations of the palace~
South of you, a pool of brackish water pushes up against a stoney shore.
Eastward, you see a small, tight cavern leading towards an upward sloping
tunnel.  The rock walls and ceiling of the foundation are slick with
moisture and the air is humid and hard on the lungs.  No light filters into
the stoney passageways.  You notice a small animal nest in the corner of the
cavern, indicating that something lived here before the yinn moved in and
built their palace.

The animal nest is fairly large and not really a nest so much as a straw

To the east, the passageway ends in a thick rock wall, but you can see a
small opening about eight feet up that apparently continues towards the
east.  It would be an easy climb.  Westward, you can hear sloshing sounds as
water trickles and tickles the stone shores of an underground pool.

foundations.  From below, you distantly hear the sound of water.  East from
this point, a small and tight tunnel opens into a very unimpressive maze of
dull grey stone walls, slick with moisture, and you hear a low growl echo
every now and then through the musty, stale air.

light in an unsettling manner.

in some kind of metal plate on the ground.  It's difficult to see from here.

the south, the rolling, playing mists make it difficult to see, and a sense
of malovence flows about with a perceptible chill from the alcove above you.

of a large opening about twenty feet higher up than your current elevation.
A climb up the pile of rock would be simple.  The tunnel appears to continue
northward from there.  It also moves southward towards a three-way inter-

of invigorating air from an unseen source.  The darkness is persistant but
not bleak or oppressive.  Regardless, strange noises emminate from unseen
vocal chords, a phenomenon which causes most people to watch their step.
Above you, a thick iron plate is hinged to the ceiling, with a large keyhold
in the center of it.  On this level, you stand at a three-way intersection,
with passages running north-south, and to the east.

You appear to have found a very old part of the foundations, as these halls
are crumbling and decrepit.  Down from here, a long drop would deposit you

A cave-in during some past event, perhaps an earthquake, has blocked off
passage to the south, but a small opening can be seen on the east side of
the cavern a few dozen feet up.  The way is not treacherous or difficult,
but it certainly looks tedious.  This passageway also runs northward.  This
area of the caverns is ancient and feels as though it could fall apart at
any moment.  A sickly-sweet smell in the air draws the attention of your
nose, causing feelings of both nausea and euphoria at the same time.  It is
a peculiar sensation, and not something that one would want to repeat with
any frequency.

Upwards from this point, a fairly steep incline leads towards a 
well-constructed part of the foundations.  The walls are smooth and carefully
created, and although there doesn't appear to have been any kind of
maintenance in the area, neither is any needed.  To the west, the tunnel leads
to a L-bend that leads south.

You stand at a kind of bend in the tunnel.  To the east, the tunnel leads
to a steep incline towards the surface.  Southwards, there appears to have
been a collapse of some kind, as the floor is little more than a gaping hole
with a tumbling mess of rocks leading towards a lower level of the caverns.

Downward from here, a rolling pile of loose rock tumbles towards a cavern
at a slightly lower elevation.  There appears to have been some kind of rock-
slide or collapse in the past.  A tunnel extends northwards from this point,
and the walls are well-carved.  This section of the foundations appears to
be fairly well-constructed.

ledge drops off into a verticle chute extending down into the bedrock, beyond
the range of your light and vision.  To the east, the platform leads towards
a set of stone stairs.

You stand before a massive door of unknown material.  By touch, it feels
metallic, but it yet has a bit of give, not much, but enough for you to sense
it.  The material reflects your light in a blinding manner, and appears to be
some kind of bizare composite.  A complicated lock has been fitted into the
center of the door.  A stairwell leads downwards from here towards a landing.

Precious little light filters through the tiny steel grate above you.  You
can see that the grate is covered with a pile of hay of straw, but it would
be a small matter to move it.  Below you, a similar opening leads towards a
rocky cavern.  You hear the stomping of hooves and an occasional whiney from
above you, accompanied by the distinct scent of manure.

A twelve foot drop from here would deposit you on a somewhat lower level of
the foundations.  This tunnel leads eastward, and an incredibly thick and
sticky mist mills about your body, seeming to take on a life of its own.
It is difficult to see, and even more difficult to breathe.

You nearly blunder into a solid rock wall, flailing about in the thick mists
and disorienting darkness of the cavern.  The passageway bends to the north
and to the west here, but it is only by feeling along the walls that you are
able to guide yourself along.  The air oppressively thick and causes the
coppery taste of blood to taint your tongue at every breath.

Flailing about, you manage to determine the tunnel moves east and south from
this point.  The horrible mists are dark and oppressive, and seem to mock
any progress you manage to make.  Unseen things slip through and around your
ankles as you try to orient yourself in the stifling darkness and nauseating
air.

The passageways terminates in a solid rock wall.  No amount of exploration
reveals anything else about where this passage may lead.  You cannot see
your hand before you face, nonetheless anything else in this dark and dismal
place.  You can sense more than hear scurrying creatures beneath your feet,
and you keep bumping your foot on some kind of metallic object on the floor.

Feeling clumsily around near your ankles, you locate a slimy metallic box,
firmly affixed to the floor.  It appears to be an iron strongbox, and years
of existing among the mists have rusted away much of its surface.  If it
had a lock, it has long since become inoperable.  You also feel something
smooth and round nearby, and it feels disturbingly like a skull.  Some things
are best left alone.
