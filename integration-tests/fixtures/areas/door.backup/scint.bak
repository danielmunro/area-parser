branches tangle into each other in a vain attempt to reach the sky. Parts
of the beach below disappear into the dense forest. Wisp of mist arise from

The rocky trail widens here and a small ledge hangs above your head. Long

wind blows in malevolent gusts and almost knocks you down. All sound is
stifled by its eerie wail resounding off the rocks. Billowy clouds swiftly
shift across the azure sky. They seem to mingle with the mist as it swirls
above the tree tops far below you. The dense forest swallows up the beach
and blocks it from your view. A large boulder sits in the center of the path.
Some sort of ancient script has been carved within its stone. The path

salt grows stronger here and waves echo softly on a slight breeze. It
chills your skin as it blows through the branches that block the path
ahead. The hair on the back of your neck prickles in warning. When you
turn around no one is there. Perhaps you should continue on your way.

The Crescent Beach~
The beach spans out before you. The trees encompass it to form a secluded,
crescent shaped alcove. The sun warms your skin and casts off the chill of
the misty forest. Waves crash against the ivory shore. Their ebb and flow
traces mystic patterns across the shimmering sands. A humid wind picks up 
in gusts and softly caresses your skin. Tall sea grass ripples at its touch.
Billowy clouds race across the azure sky and cast surreal shadows across the
restless sea. Flashes of multicolored light twinkle across its ultramarine
waves as tiny dragon like creatures wink in and out of existence. The soft
cadence of waves resounding off the beach lulls you and eases the stress of
your long journey.

The sun shimmers off the ultramarine sea. Waves echo off the shore with a

wind caresses your skin and blows the sea spray across it. The waves lap
against your feet as they scatter bits of seaweed and driftwood across the
shore. Cranes fly low in search of food. The azure sky stretches out before
you and merges with the sea. Clouds swiftly shift across it and cast surreal
shadows upon the restless waves. The cry of cranes echoes faintly on the

You walk along a narrow strip of sand. The trees thin out to merge with a
sheer basalt cliff that rises up to tower above you. The surf rushes to
meet the shore and leaves foamy patterns across the tide line. The waves
deposit seaweed and small shells as they recede back into the sea. The
crash of waves echoes off the cliffs in a continual murmer. Billowy clouds
race across the azure sky as it merges with the sea. Dozens of tiny foot-
prints scatter across the sand. They end abruptly as if going nowhere. You
see something move out of the corner of your eye. When you turn to look
nothing is there.

You walk along a narrow strip of beach. The forest thins out to merge with a
sheer basalt cliff. It rises up to tower above you then extends out into the
sea. It forms a huge arch between the sea and the shore. Waves crash against
its edge and toss foam high into the air. Sunlight glitters off the mist and
forms hundreds of tiny rainbows within the center of the arch. The sun hangs
in the azure sky and warms your skin. The wind picks up in gusts blowing the
mist across your skin chilling it. Huge boulders rise up out of the sea. You

The waves batter your boat. The ultramarine sea stretches out before you to
merge with the azure sky. Its clear, blue water reveals a sea of life below
you. The sand swirls, caught between the conflicting currents of the tide. 
Several sailfish circle a school of smaller fish. They charge in, impaling
a few on their long, sharp noses. A mermaid appears before you and splashes
water in your direction. She smiles mischievously then disappears back into
the sea. In the distance, the arch rises up to tower above you.

The arch arises from the sea to your east. It towers above the waves which

The Bottom within the Arch~
Your light flickers off the black, basalt walls with ghostly scintillations.
Emormous, black stone gargoyles have been carved into the circular walls. 
Their faces are forever frozen in hideous screams. You light flickers eerie
shadows across their ebony wings. Their eyes glint red and wings appear to
flutter as if trying to escape the black stone which binds them. A narrow
staircase carved within the walls spirals up into an endless darkness. The
sound of shattering stone pierces the magical stillness which hangs in the
air. A hideous scream echoes off the walls. You try to run but it is too

out and twist their way around the room. Lacy tendrils flow beside them
and form foamy patterns, which pool at the wide end of the room. The stone
carvings depict an enormous whirlpool tipped over on its side. A black,
scaled carving snakes its way around the room. It coils across the walls
and ceiling, then disappears into the ebony chasm. You feet lose their
grip, and you slide across the stone floor almost plummeting to your death.
Vertigo hits you, as the chasm disappears into the darkness far below you.

light crackles across the wall. It transforms black stone into scarlet 
scales. You stand frozen in horror while it turns its massive head towards

it erupts against the sea floor. Lacy tendrils of bubbles spiral downward,
caught within it torrential currents. They erupt against the huge rocks and
form vaporous clouds. Their white bubbles mingle briefly with the swirling
sand then arise to the surface of the sea far above you. A glowing, scarlet
chest lies within the center of the eye. Its crystalline surface shimmers
while a faint hum vibrates from within it. You stare in utter amazement and

ripple as water slowly drips off the stalactites which hang above them. Their
phosphorescent surfaces illuminate the ceiling with wavy circles of light.
The only sound is the rhythmic drip of water.

The Sea Cavern~
You stand on a small semicircular ledge. Sheer, stone walls drop away into
fathomless darkness. The sea churns like an inky caldron below you. Waves
crash against the stone walls and blast sea spray high into the air. A
fierce wind rips at your armor as it howls through the cavern. Its phantom
wail echoes off the cavern walls with an unearthly cry. Darkness shrouds
the depth of the cavern. You cannot tell where the narrow ledge ends and
the inky sea begins. Something brushes against you in the blackness. You
think a vague form hovers beside you but it is hard to tell in the darkness.

The narrow trail~
The trail grows more narrow as you continue deeper into the forest. All
signs of animal life disappear from the trees. The trail continues west.
