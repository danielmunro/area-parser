The Entrance to Town Homes East.~
You have entered Town Homes east.  A canopy of trees form a clearing with
defiant paths leading west east and south.  The entire area has been
preserved from the natural forest it was constructed in; it is clear that the
town home builders decided to go a complete contrast to the city like
aspect of the western town homes and keep the natural forest setting
that is lost in so many other construction projects.

As you follow this stream, a new meaning to the term tranquillity
comes to you.  Pleasant animals dart back and forth and the
occasional rainbow trout jumps from the stream.  The bank is
covered with soft grass with the occasional tree that gives
shade from the sun, perfect for a short nap.
The stream continues north and south.

Foyer~
You enter a remarkably beautiful reception room from a door in the
southwest, a marble lion statue guards the entrance.  White marble
walls are adorned by a glowing gold leaf while lants line the east
and west sides of the room, and deep red carpeting pads your footsteps.
The painted domed ceiling depicts a battle between demonic and
angelic creatures and is separated into four groups, by four statues.
A monk on the north side,  berzerker on the east, a samurai on the
south and a sagely wizard on the west.  As the painting rises to the
top of the dome, the battle scene gives way to blue sky and then a
starry darkness to the apex.  At the north end of the Foyer there is
a fountain with a beautiful woman holding out a sword, with a liquid
running down the blade filling the pool around her.

A strong gust of frigid air blows over you, sending a deep chill through
your body.  You enter the cave cautiousuly, the floor is sheer ice and
declines rapidly.
You glance around and notice huge icicles both protruding from teh floor,
and hanging from the ceiling, pointing down at you like huge spears.
A fissure snakes across the cave floor, and you contemplate trying to jump
it, or heading back.

The floor starts to level out and you find it a little easier to stand.  Your
eyes start to focus in the dim light, and you see colorful blurs in the icy
walls.
Upon further inspection you realise what your looking at, animals of all
kinds, elk, deer, bears, and a few larger creatures you can't make out.
Everything about this cave sends a chill down your spine.
There is what appears to be a small well in the far corner of the cavern.
A blast of warm air rushes over you as you peer down into the well.
There is a faint red glow at the bottom of the well, but its so far, it
seems miles away...

Raindrop of Love~
Taking a deep breath, your lungs fill with a magical water of true

or starlight in a continual array of dancing, bouncing and singing.  A
huge bed sculpted of the innocent light of an autumn day beckons you to
sit and lay on its plush, comfortable surface.  
    A subtle warmth grips your heart, the mystical water
massages your body, and washes your troubles away.  If you listen quietly,
you can hear the beating of the loving heart echo across the rainbow of
lights and colors.

Backyard of Crimson and Dalina~
A crystal clear lake with a sandy bottom is surrouned by a forest
of magestic virgin hardwood trees.  The harmony of crickets, birds, and
various woodland creatures singing fills the woods.  
     A small path leads down to a colorful, lush garden full of ripe
apples, oranges, pairs and other exotic fruits and vegetables.
     On the beach, a slight breeze blows a sweet gust of Crimson's love
as a reminder of his eternal love for Dalina.
     A patch of verdant grass offers a solace to lay under the midnight
sky and watch the sparkling lights of a thousand stars dance nimbly about.
In the daylight, it is an elegant place to play, and would be ideal for
the child at heart, or at heart playing with children.
     To the north lies a circle of trees, the sunlight shines
brightly on a single crimson rose, a small drop of rain lays peacefully on
the brim of the most beautiful petal.  If you reach north to touch the
drop of water, you might just fall into its magical kingdom.

In the Shadow of the Mountain~
You are standing in a small valley in the shadow of a mountain.
A great waterfall cascades down the granite cliffs into a deep
pool of dark azure water.  Koi dart amongst the rocks in the shallows
of the pool and small bubbles ocasionally stream up from its' depths.
From the pool, there is smaller waterfall that empties into a large basin
of white marble.
Four jets of water shoot from the sides of the basin in beautiful arcs.
They cross over a large stone gargoyle that is sitting on a raised dias 
in the middle of the fountain.  A deep, soothing voice eminates from this 
guardian when you enter this valley.
It says,  "Welcome friends, to the humble abode of Angella and Boogums...".
No matter where you move, the gargoyles jewelled eyes seem to follow you.
A path has been hewn along the sides of the fountain and pool. The large steps
lead to what appears to be a small grotto behind the torrent of water.

A large, Warm Comfortable Cavern~
A large, well lit cavern is warmed by a huge fire that is roaring in 
the fireplace.  Three giant braziers are burning bright with a magical,
smokeless fire.  The amber light from these braziers casts a warm
and comforting light on this room.  From high in each corner,  small stone
gargoyles watch over this place.

The Breezy Porch for Lazy Afternoons~
You stand on a large covered porch surrounded by rocking chairs and swings 
swaying gently from the beams above your head. Here the breeze is always 
gentle and summer sweet, filled with the smell of blooming flowers and fresh 
cut grass. You hear a thumping sound, and notice one of Eltanins' hounds 
under a swing, tapping his tail on the porch in welcome of you.  Off the 
back of the porch, a set of steps lead down to the log cabin, which 
Eltanin and BriarRose built entirely by hand, their love infused into every 
joint and boardof the structure.  A long boardwalk leads off the side of the 
porch down to a shimmering lake. where the view of sunsets are incredible.

The Livingroom~
A horsehoe hangs from over the door for luck.  You walk through the broad
doorway into a large living room.  On your right is a giant stone hearth taking
up most of the wall, and a warm inviting fire blazes in the large fireplace.
In front of the hearth a soft brown bearskin rug covers the stone floor.  To
the right of the fireplace is a set of handmade bookshelves filled with family
pictures and vases of fresh flowers.
Looking over, you notice the trophies from Eltanins' latest hunting expedition
hanging on the wall across from you.  In the center of the room facing the 
fireplace is a large U-shaped sofa.

Light filters through the streaming water of the waterfall, patterning

A slow moving river heads into the tunnel stretching into the darkness.
The water of the river is clear, and the pebbles on the bottom can be seen

through the waterfall, or jump in the river.

The aroma of fresh-baked bread lingers in this sunlit country kitchen.
Homemade jams and jellies line a shelf on the wall next to a beautiful oak
hutch filled with hand-thrown pottery.  Heavy pots and pans interspersed
with bunches of dried flowers hang from a ceiling rack, and a recessed
window over the sink gives a spectacular view of the lake while allowing
room for Tali to grow her favorite herbs.  An open cookbook titled "101 Ways
with Mushrooms" lies on the kitchen table near a hand-written recipe for
Wolflord's Famous French Toast.  Pull up one of the intricately carved
chairs and sip tea from a sturdy earthenware mug while enjoying a generous
slice of oven-warm bread covered thickly with jam.

You find yourself in a courtyard facing a small country cottage. A 
stream dances over brightly colored rocks and flows beneath a white 
footbridge. Rosebushes for a hedge on either side of the path, 
surrounding you with a heady scent from their full-bodied blossoms. 
The roses continue their climb up the walls of the cottage, small 
tendrils grasping and finding purchase, winding their way through 
the shutters to surround the windows with their simple bauty. The 
urge to rest on the bridge and dangle your toes in the water is 
nearly overwhelming. Go ahead, Tonak and Emme won't mind, but their

The windows you see span the entire front of the home...with the trim painted
a deep forest green.
You see exquisite art tastefully decorating the entire first floor.  The large

Also on the cloud sits the lower end of a great stairway made
completely out of light and lined with stars. It leads up seemingly

behind you and a path to reality is open once again. You decide not to

paper.  The walls are adorned with all kinds of ancient eastern weapons.
Through the slightly opened paper doors on the far wall, the sunlight
illuminates the room.  Past the doors you see a spacious Japanese garden
with various flowers and bushes.  On the surface of a small pond in the
middle of the garden, the sunlight dances merrily around the colorful carp

the ground under your feet suddenly separated with a loud "CRACK!" and began
drifting slowly away from the rest of the land...
 
You are now on what appears to be an iceberg, floating in the middle of the
ocean. You can sit back, relax, and let the current take you south, to the
icy continent of Antarctica, or you can try to steer yourself northwards, 
back to Townhomes East. It's a tough choice, but make it quick. It's start-

Freyja's Humble Abode~
Entering this room the gleaming sunlight catches your eye.  To the east
a large bay window overlooks a small babbling brook.  All your worries
are left behind when you entered this room.  It's quiet atmosphere
welcomes you with open arms.
The white walls look remarkably soft in contrast to the hard wood floors
beneath your feet.
A cozy wine-coloured couch sits in the corner next to a small pine
coffee table.  On the table there sits a vase: in it, a small red rose.

Trying to enter this door could be difficult for you,... it's only 3 
and a half foot tall.
The door itself seems to be made of wood,.. except for the knocker...
The knocker seems... ALIVE...????!!!!
As you examine the knocker, WAIT, it might have been alive once...
It is a deep aqua colored face.
It's defintely a goblin's face.. or it might have been at one time.
He wears a BIG smile and a broken nose.

The Icy Beaches of Antarctica~
You have arrived on the coastline of the chilly continent of Antarctica, 
home of snow, ice... and penguins. You can see some of those loveable 
characters now, waddling around, chatting to each other, and taking dives 
into the icy water. How adorable. As you admire them, you suddenly realize 
how FREEZING it is! Average temperature for this time of year is about -65 
degrees Celsius, so you *might* want to think about getting someplace 
warmer. Looking around a bit, you see it is a beautiful sunny day. If it 
weren't for the climate, you might consider this a good picnic spot. Off 
to the east, you can make out the entrance to a small hovel, sculpted in 
the side of a little icy hill. The black markings above the door appear to
read: "Harry's Habitat." How peculiar. You can stay here and explore this 
beautiful, sunny, COLD continent, or you can go north and wait a little 
while for the next iceberg to break off and take you away from this god-
forsaken rock.

of the room. This altar is probly the resting place of it's occupant. Upon 
a closer look, you notice that someone opened this stone coffin. A scary
feeling takes you as the torches fades and a stone slab shuts the only exit.
Everything goes dark as you embrace death.

Inside the old Victorian House~
Walking up the stone steps to the verandah of a old Victorian house,
you open the huge oaken double doors and enter the spacious living
room.  The sun shines softly through the deep blue drapes of the
large windows on the far wall illuminating the living area.  To
you right, you see a large open fireplace decorated with exquisite
tiles of colors that emulate burning fire.  Above the mantle of the
fireplace is a large mirror and a small framed poem.  In front of
the fireplace on the polished hardwood floor lies a soft Persian rug.
A deep blue carpet runs up the staircase which climbs around the
cherry-stained walls of the room.  A beautiful chandelier hangs from
the ceiling, its crystals sparling in the morning sun.

poem~
Looking closely at the framed poem, you see that it is written
by Cephas for Stare:
 
Make a Wish
 
Ageless and immortal stone
dwelt in space but never shone.
He was unmoved by pain and death;
eternal life without a breath.
His only price to death defy
was to himself all love deny.
 
But now her heav'nly beauty found
his longing Stare forever bound.
Could he carress a face so fair
and hope of future they may share?
Transfixed upon her eyes so blue
he cared not what was false or true.
Aband'ning was and is to be
he fell into her gravity.
 
A golden thread falling above,
he finally found that light and love
could he in giving all, attain.
His arms spread wide embraced the pain.
 
Brightly burning.
 
Swiftly
 
Perishing.

A Cozy Bedroom~
Cephas and Stare's bedroom is the color of the night.  The shadows
on the cold marble walls seem to dance in the candle light.  In the
middle of the room is a large waterbed covered with silken sheets
and a warm down comforter.  Above the bed, the ceiling is made
completely of glass, making a circular window towards the stars.
Through the glass sliding doors to your left, you see a large
balcony overlooking the faint flicker of torchlight of the city of
New Thalos and the dark shadows of the trees in the enchanted grove.

A broad ledge above the treasure chamber makes a perfect spot to rest.
A large opening in the side of the mountain shows you a breath taking view.
From here you can see the other town homes, tiny little boxes scattered
around the small city of Midgaard with its little city walls. Fields and
forests stretch over the landscape as far as you can see, covering the
hills and valleys. Far away, the people of New Thalos and Ofcol look like 
ants. Only the mountains of Olympus and their gods look real, the rest of 
the world seems lost in a dreamy haze. Looking up, a big fluffy cloud the 
shape of a dragon floats lazily around the top of the mountain.

You have stumbled onto a huge mound of earth and wonder why you

steps lead up to the crest of the mound where it has been levelled off.
Oddly shaped stones lie along the edge of the crest encircling a small
hut at the center.  White smoke billows out of the cracks of the hut's
mud and twig makeup, but you see no light, nor feel any heat eminating
from it.

Tree Fort~
You find yourself inside what appears to be a child's tree fort.
The room is octagonal with a window on the north, east, south, and 
west walls.  A large willow tree is growing through the center of
the room, giving support to the floor.  The branches of this
Ancient Tree form a domed roof over the diminutive room, almost
as if by magik.  Many Ancient Runes are carved, burned and etched
onto the trunk and branches of the Tree.  Perhaps they are the
reason this massive deciduous has withstood the weathering of
Father Time so well.
  Shiny Jewels and shimmering Emeralds catch your eyes no matter
which way your head turns.  The gold leafed table, however, seems
uninteresting compared to the extravagently bejewelled hammock that
is strung up between the trunk of the tree and its northern wall.
 
  A trap door in the floor offers you an escape.

As you walk off the main road you find yourself standing at the edge

to flare.  As you look around you see acres upon acres of cannabis
growing free and wild.  Off to one side a small sign reads "Belevairn's
Property!  Go Away!".  Off to the east you see a small cabin with smoke
billowing out of the chimney.  Along the fence line you see heads jammed
onto the posts.  A stiff penalty must have befallen these adventurers 
who had ventured to close to these fields.

smoke filled cabin you see a small comfy bed, a nice padded recliner,
a round card table, and a small fireplace filled with dying embers. 
On the table sits a few cannabis buds and a pack of rolling papers just
begging to be made into a spliff.  All along the walls of the cabin are
weapons hanging from hooks, they are all well shined and oiled, showing
that the owner of this cabin is a true Weaponsmaster.

a large rock formation with what seems to house some sort of Temple.
As you walk along the Dunes, the ground begins to quake and thunder
can be heard in the distance.  Out of the corner of your eyes you see a
monsterous worm rising from under the sand and looks as though it is
heading straight towards you!!  You had better make a run for the

You have entered into the main room of Harry's habitat;  the rec room.
Despite the cool climate and the walls of ice that support this place,
there is still a certain aura of warmth and friendliness to it.  As you
take a closer look, you are surprised to see all the junk Harry has
lying around.  There are no shelves or bookcases, so he keeps most of it
on the icy floor.  Several confidential PIB folders are scattered
throughout the room, as well as Harry's "Best of Ravenna" record collection,
and leftover buttons and banners from his "Harry for Mayor" campaign.  A
few photographs of his friends line the walls;  you see snapshots of
Boogums, Tonak, Wolflord, Taliena, Pazrael, Nishmael, and many more.  You
notice the absence of a bed in this junk.  You can stay here a while,
grab a soft drink and play a little pinball, or you can venture into 
the other half of Harry's home, to the south.  Of course, there's always
the beach, back to the west.

Potted plants are placed around the room, giving it an even cozier feel.
There is less junk in here than in the rec room, but items like leftover
HaryldDay wrapping paper and empty boxes of fish fingers still clutter the
floor.  A large jacuzzi sits against the wall, shooting hot water from its
jets.  Gigantic pillows lie on the floor for those who don't enjoy getting
wet.  A huge picture window encompasses the entire south wall, displaying

The Pine Glade~
The pine glade is a place where the mind can be free and the body can relax
from the constant tension of battle.  The ground is soft but crunches
slightly under your feet.  The forest floor is essentially a blanket of dead
pine needles littered over the ground, the result of years of the
magnificent trees shedding their needles.  The golden sun peeks through the
pine boughs that frame the perfectly periwinkle blue sky.  The air is silent
and still.  Occasional shrill but pleasant bird calls break the silence and
echo through the fresh air.  You feel yourself slipping into an almost
heavenly meditative trance as you stand here and witness nature at her
communal best.  Like another plane of existence, a near nirvana, this
ethereal pine glade is a wonderful place to rest and restore your life force.

You step into a seemingly dank and lifeless cavern.
 
Soft and soulful jazz music eminates from the walls. You hear a voice from
somewhere in the dark back of the cave say "Hey baby, come on back here and
I'll show you a good time,".  Taking this unknown voice up on its offer ,
you step cautiously towards its source.  Suddenly a lava lamp lights up and
spreads its groovy light throughout the cave.  The light reveals what looks
like a really nifty bead curtain.  You part the beads and enter the hidden
room. The floor is carpeted with a very hip shag rug.   Sitting temptingly
on a bean bag chair is a youthful and virile looking silver dragon.  He
extends a claw and pulls you down into his lap, tail thumping happily on the
floor.  "Welcome to the Lair o' Love, baby," he says with a devilish grin...

David's Den~
This den would appear to double as David's living space. Instead of walls
the room is enclosed by huge bookcases that stretch from the floor to the
roof. You see all types of books. There are ancient classics, religious
texts, histories and even a spell book or two. One end of the room is
dominated by high-backed leather chairs that surround a cracling fire.
David's immense oak desk sits just outside the half-circle of chairs. The
other side of the room holds a large bed heaped with blankets and pillows.

Living Room~
You have entered Azuth Fol'deren's house.
Inside this room you see all kinds of strange experiments taking place.
On a table in the middle of the room, bottles containing strangly colored
liquids are resting. Huge piles of papers, scribed with different notes,
are spread over the floor and create a rather large mess in the room. At a
small table in the far corner rests a small crystal ball on a silver
tripod. A clear light, created by small globes floating under the ceiling,
fills the room.

coming from 4 small globes floating in each corner of the ceiling. A large
bed is placed in the room, along with a small desk and a large bookshelf.
On the desk lies a few books and a quill is placed on top of them. The
bookshelf is full of books with strange writings on their backs. A blanket
is placed under the bed.

Inside A Giant Sequoia~
You have entered through an opening in the base of this Giant 
Sequoia tree, and to your surprise you realize that the inside of 
this tree has been hollowed out for someone to live here.  A magical
fountain gushes in the centre of this faintly lit room with cold 
water to quench your thirst.  You are about to take a sip from this 
magical fountain when you catch a glimpse of a black pipe feeding to 
the fountain from the base of the tree.  The magic of this fountain 
is nothing more than stolen irrigation water from the farmer next 
door!  You have a sudden urge to report this blatant theft of water, 
but you hear footsteps approaching from outside the tree. You realize 
the owners are home, and they won't be happy to find you here.  If 
you don't leave now, this will become your permanent resting place.

You realize that all those years of eating Oat Bran and Ginseng
to increase your longevity may have been a waste.  There isn't
enough fiber in your diet to save you from a mean old dragon's
breath weapon.  As you pass out from the deep wounds to your head, 
you manage to press the red button on the little device that hangs 
on the chain around your neck, and utter the words, "Help, I've 
fallen and I can't get up!".  You fall to the floor unconscious.  
Help is on the way, and you'll be ready to do battle again.

The Great Willow Tree~
After climbing up the seemingly endless rope ladder, it's a relief
to step onto the large, wooden platform below you.  Glancing up, you
notice that a space of only a few feet separates you from a thick canopy
of leaves.  Peering down, the forest floor appears a tad blurry.  A leaf
falls from overhead, and you watch its long flight down to the earth it
came from.  You realize suddenly that you feel like a part of nature up
here, and that you'd like nothing better than to remain in the
tranquility of this tree indefinitely.  A tree swing moves slowly in the
breeze, beckoning to you from the eastern end of the platform

The Tree Swing~
The wind blows through the tree, causing it to sway and rocking you
gently back and forth as you sit in the swing.  You lift your face up to
the sunshine and smile as the wind plays with your hair.  Somewhere
nearby a robin sings, celebrating the beautiful day, and down beneath
you can see the stream glinting in the sun as it skips merrily along.

Quiggles' Garden~
Stepping down from the tree, you find yourself once again beside the
stream.  All around you green things bloom and the scent of clover is
thick in the air.  You sit down on a mossy bank and idly dangle your
toes in the water, watching a heron nearby and basking in the warm
sunshine.  Behind you are the rows of flowers and herbs lovingly tended
by Quiggles' hand.  Ivy grows over an old stone wall, forming the
northern boundary to the garden.  In the center of the garden, a small
fountain bubbles, covered with wild roses and morning glories.

Nishmael's Cozy Corner~
A tree may be a rather awkward place to find a dwarf, but Nishmael
appears to have made himself at home here.  A small portion of the
massive trunk was apparently eroded by the effects of nature, and now it
forms a perfect hollow to sit against.  Carved carefully, directly above
the eroded spot, is a small inscription that draws your curious eyes.
Seeing as how penguins can't fly or climb, you're startled to see one
perched on a branch, grinning widely at you.  Odd.  Perhaps you should
wander back in the direction of the tree swing . . .

As you walk inside, you see a large hexagonal room about 15 feet high and
30 feet in diameter.  The walls and ceiling seem to be made of a strange metal
that is giving off a soft white light.  There is a recessed circle pattern
spaced out evenly in the walls.  The floor is a glossy black metal that has
no marks in its surface.
Along the far wall there is an odd looking viewscreen.  Faintly in the
background you can hear Beethoven playing.
There are a set of double doors to the south.

You have entered a large room.  Several white pillars support the room
above.  There are a few stone benches surrounding a large beautiful fountain.
The room is alive with green plants of different kinds that are hanging from
the walls and pillars.  The warm moist air is clear and smells sweet to you.
There is a soft white light in the room that appears to come from all around
you.  You can hear a distant humming coming from every direction.
 
As you look around the room you notice a wrought iron spiral staircase leading
up, a large statue of a gold dragon to the east, a glittering silver door to
the south, and a stone archway leading west.  The control room is visible to
the south.

The soft light of the torches reveal a bare dirt floor.
Apparently, this is not the same designer as the entrance room.
A hay bed sets in the north-west corner.
A painting hangs just above the bed.  In the foreground, a older
noble man stands with his long grey hair in a ponytail.
In the background, a large flat roofed fortess looms sliently.
The only other item in the room is a large weapons rack.
It appears only to have swords on it though; Big swords, little swords,
wooden swords, a flaming sword, and three crystal hilts with no blades.
All of these appear to have been used more than once.

A crystal clear lake with a sandy bottom is surrounded by a forest
of majestic virgin hardwood trees.  The harmony of crickets, birds,
and various woodland creatures' singing fills the woods. A small path
leads to a colorful, lush garden full of ripe apples, oranges, pears
and other exotic fruits and vegetables. A patch of verdant grass
offers a solace to lay under the midnight sky and watch the sparkling
lights of a thousand stars dance nimbly about. In the daylight, it is
an elegant place to play, and would be ideal for the child at heart,
or playing with children. A circle of trees, the sunlight shines
brightly on a single crimson rose, a small drop of rain lies peace-
fully on the brim of the most beautiful petal.  If you reach north to
touch the drop of water, you might just fall into its magical kingdom.

Study~
This study is quite unusual, it's more like a Japanese
garden that encompasses the entire room, where curved stone paths make the
room accessible, and a vine coverd glass celing allows light to flow. A
large mossy rock mound in the center of the north wall bubbles over with
spring water, softly cascading into the pond below, which stops in front of
the training circle in the center of the room, and curves around the mound.
You also notice about 10 red and gold koi in the pond, and maybe on black
one.  From the door in the east, one path leads to the training circle and
forks leading to 2 chairs and a desk in the northeast corner.  You realize
that this is where Darkblade concentrates on his deadly skills, the
training circle has many targets, posts, bars and other various objects
used for honing the art of combat.  From the circle two more paths are
accessible, one leads to the northwest corner where a gold and lead yin
yang lies in the center of a groomed rock garden, the other path curves
westward by a number of plants and a stone pagoda that peeks out from the
foliage, and stops at the south wall where a washing basin rests. Despite
the deadly nature of this room it seems quite peaceful, and the calming
nature of the garden puts your mind at ease.

The Base of a Mighty Redwood Tree~
You stand at the base of a Giant Redwood Tree.  It towers almost
300ft into the misty clouds above.  There are many woodland creatures
playing about the tree.  Upon closer examination you notice a tiny
door about fifteen feet above your head.  The door is cut right into
the side of the tree.  Coming from the branches above, you hear the
festive sounds of singing and giggling.

The wretched scent of death and decay fills the small room.
The black-steel walls are plastered with the blood of the many 
unfortunate souls that were slaughtered by the hands of Neural and Riff.
Disemboweled corpses line the floor waiting to be disposed of.
Great piles of precious treasures lie strewn about the pit.
In the corner of the room is a stairway to the fun-house.
Insane screams of pain and terror come from below.

they need to survive. However judging by the iridescent glow given off by the
plants you have a feeling no sunshine is needed at all for these plants to
grow. in the center of this cave there is a large steel door on the floor
leading even further down. From beneath you can hear the sound of machinery
clanging away aswell is the odd swishing sounds of some sort of liquid being
moved around below you.you are tempted to investigate however the doorway
down seems to be shielded by a magical barrier.oh well might aswell head

lights are just waiting to be used. A fancy black piano sits in the more
quiet corner for other occasions. Hop onto the plush, red barstool
and rest for a while here.

yet noble beauty. A thick coat of ivy is sprawled over its edge and birds
chirp carelessly among the nearby trees. A stone bench is off to the side,
cool and hard to sit on. A Roman-style statue of a female anthro-cat
stands on the other side.

Apparently you've entered some secret place of hers... the soothing
sounds of water trickle merrily in a thin stream. The brook weaves through
delicate trimmings of various plants and rocks with colorful splashes of
petals here and there. A weeping willow stands in a clearing, the place
where the kitten enjoys sun-bathing and philosophizing. Crickets can
be heard in the bushes and birds sing freely in the air. Fishes of varying
size swim in her stream and tiny frogs sit on the rocks as well. Stone
carvings of pagodas, dragons, and cats line the walkway and
compliment the already aesthetic garden. Nature is in abundance
 here and you are embraced within Her arms.

gracefully.  They must have come from hills far away.  There are rich
tapestries hiding much of the walls.  Each one depicts some part of the
long and heroic history of the Dwarven people.   You notice a small

purple flower.  A calm sweeps over you.

On the wall hangs a quote, "Why worry about the small things in life? There 
are only two things in this world: things you can eat and things you can not

Filled with mirrors absolutely everywhere, here the kitten is able to drown

counter and bathroom, and even the ceiling reflect all. The white counter
has two sinks, and in between them sits a tray (yet another mirror) full of
shapely colored bottles. On the other side of the bathroom, there is a little
dresser that she can sit at (mirror!); on the dresser, there is a classic
perfume bottle with a squeezy puffy thing. There is also a shower and
jacuzzi, with plaster hands that stick out of the wall to hold soap and
towels. There is no litterbox, but a regular toilet, in case you are curious
The floor is carpeted in a slight off-white and the room is lit by
fluorescent lights. It's difficult to imagine how many hours a day the
kitten spends grooming here.

A well lit cave~
You stand in awe of the sheer size of this room.  Stalactites and 
stalagmites have grown together to form vast pillars of stone.  Their 
upper reaches are lost in shadows.  One side of the cave has veins of 
quartz running through it, and sunlight is being reflected through them 
down from the surface.  The sunlight gives the cave an unnatural 
warmth, and most of the moisture has evaporated.  A pool of crystal 
clear water has collected at the base of one of the pillars of stone, 
and what looks like smooth white stones line the bottom.  Further back, 
a natural fissure has opened, but it looks as if the rough edge of the 
rock has been polished.   This looks like the perfect spot to rest.

As you look around, you notice that the walls in here have the same 
smooth finish as the mouth of the fissure above you.  It definitely 
doesn't look natural, though there is some steam rising from vents in 
the rock on the floor some distance away.  Scattered about the room are 
several large scales, and you realize that you have entered the home of 
a very large Silver Dragon.  To the left is an enormous pile of 
treasure!  There are countless diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and 
sapphires scattered through huge piles of gold.  Wicked looking 
weapons, and exotic pieces of armor peek through the treasure in some 
spots.  A well placed mirror reflects the sunlight from above, lighting 
the room nicely.  A pile of junk sits in one corner, and you chuckle 
politely as you remember what a packrat Poon is.

as here, a clear and clean room.

Anti-Matook HeadQuarters~
If you have the Matook flag, you have entered the wrong place. Here is 
where the conspiring against the dreadful clan Matook happens. The evil 
leader of the Anti-Matooks, Uniden, plans the downfall of Matook in this 
very place.  Dont dare to oppose this great leader or you will be the next to 
fall.  You start to wonder where this great leader could be.  Well if you 
didnt know already, he is the master of illusion, he could be here right now, 
or he could be out on the job right now getting rid of the Matooks.  He also 
might be up in his suite keeping away from the public.

Anti-Matook Suites~
Here is where Uniden comes to get away from it all.  He can rest his mind 
without worries of someone coming in.  Please be quiet if you plan to stay 
or Uniden will call upon his Anti-Matooks to eat you.  Around the room you 
see pictures of naked faeries, volares, and elves.  If you dont like them 
then LEAVE!  Uniden seems to like to have fun here as the room is all 
messed up.  If you plan on staying long try to clean up a little.

Charlie's Crib~
You stand inside a small square room. The walls on 3 sides
are painted white and textured, while the ceiling and the
frame to the sliding-door closet have a natural wood finish.
The closet is to the north and just to the right of that is a
white door with a mirror mounted in the center of it. The
sliding closet doors are made of mirror with a black-metal
frame, inside there is clothing and a small box marked
"Stash Box - do not open." Next to the east wall is a
comfortable metal-framed futon in the bed position. It is
covered with grey, cotton undersheets, two fluffy pillows
and a dark green comforter. The south wall of this room has
two windows, one is blocked by a large multi-layer Ikea desk.
There is a full tower ATX computer with many fans inside,
filling the room with an ambiant buzzing noise. On the desk
is a monitor, keyboard, mouse and scattered with many CDs and
other items. There are books on the top self of the desk
along with a lava lamp and a CD tower. The western wall has
many posters of videogames and pictures of beautiful models.
There is a large, wooden, metal-framed work bench scattered
with computer cases and parts. The door to the north looks like
the best exit, unless you want to sneak out the window and
down the wall.

Keith's Crib~
The room's distinctive odor tells you that it's keeper has spent
many hours here. The only light source is a 21" Cornerstone
monitor sitting on a false-oak desk, emitting a soft radiant
glow. You have to adjust your eyes to see everything. In front
of the monitor is a keyboard and two mice. Just to the left of
the monitor is a keyboard/mouse switch. Underneath the desk
there are two ATX towers, one to play on and one to run the
network. To the right of the desk, on top of an old, copper TV
tray, there is a large aquarium with a small, red Siamese
fighting fish. The aquarium is marked Pookie's Crib. Pookie
swims out from behind a fake-plant to stare at you, pleading for
a few Betta Bites while moving back and forth to show his
sincerity. A 'Black Panthers' poster on the right wall catches
your eye, the panther appears to be leaping out of the picture,
and another poster to the right of the first one depicts a 9mm
in detail. Sliding closet doors cover the entire left wall of
the room. There is a twin bed in the center of the room, just
to the left of the door, with a dinosaur-print comforter. It
looks tempting, not too firm, and not too soft. Behind the desk
is a large rectangular window with the shades closed to block
out the world beyond. The only exit is south, over the piles of
laundry and through the door you came in from.

The Temple of Huitzilopochtli~
Statues of the winged daemon deity Huitzilopochtli surround this room 
seeming almost lifelike.  At the far edge the room you see two guards.  
Complete with black wings, horns, and long tails, these guards would
do anything to protect the name of Huitzilopochtli.  They notice the 
intruder of this sacred temple and with fangs bared, they take flight
and come after you. You look behind yourself and notice the doors 
have slammed shut leaving you trapped.  With the guards gaining you
have no choice but to look for an alternate exit.  You run franticly around
the room and stumble upon a switch, which opens a secret passage.  
Having no other choice, you walk through.

The Sacrificial Pit~
If you are here, you either entered the wrong room or are the next
sacrifice.  Either way you WILL be the next sacrifice, like it or not.
You see a pile of skeletons in the corner of the room and jars of organs
and blood on the shelves on the wall. You notice a large blood stained
pillar in the center of the room with shackles to hold people in place.
A jeweled dagger is also resting on the edge of this pillar.  You turn 
around to walk out of the room and the large guards grab you by the
shoulders and shackle you to the pillar.  A man in black cloaks walks 
into the room uttering prayers. He grabs the dagger and raises it above 
your chest.  He begins the rapid decent of the dagger to your heart and
you scream...... AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
