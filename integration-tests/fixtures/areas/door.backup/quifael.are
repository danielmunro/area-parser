Inside the Ancient Tree~
You are underneath the oldest tree in Miden'nir, the Ancient Tree. The
walls of this burrow are mostly hard mud and rock, but wooden
supports are present. A silk rope leads upwards through a narrow shaft,
into the darkness above.

Living Room~
This is the largest old fashion living room you've ever seen. Many
comfortable couches and mats are positioned in a circle around a round
oak table, piled with armor, weapons and various items, which sits on a
red mat in the center. The clan healer walks around, tending to the
wounded who lay on the couches. A cool breeze rushes through the
windows, making a soothing noise of rustling leaves.

~

bookcase bookcases volume volumes book books~
Most of the books are heavy, leatherbound and covered in a thin layer of dust.
There are many titles on necromancy, conjuring and other spheres of Magick,
but also some on computer science (although these seem to be VERY dusty
indeed) and a fair collection of horror literature, ranging from Bram Stoker
and H. P. Lovecraft to Anne Rice and Stephen King.

Entrance Hall of the Apocalypse~
You stand in the center of a large entrance hallway. The floorboards creak
softly as you move across the hall, admiring the many trophies from
victories against great beasts and evil foes, which are nailed high up on
the walls. Oil lanterns hang lower on the walls, lighting the dark interior of
the tree. The Doomsday clock is on the north wall, ticking away ominously. A
silk rope ladder hangs through a trap door, leading into the burrow below.
 A pair of open double doors lead west onto a bridge attached to another
tree of the forest. In the east wall is a spiral stair case leading even
further up the Ancient Tree.

On the desk is a peculiar apparatus of glass bottles and globes connected by
small pipelines.  The green liquid inside the apparatus' globes and pipelines
is bubbling steadily.
~

shelves~
The shelves contain a mass of bottles, jars and boxes of different shapes and
sizes, of which some contain powders and liquids in various colours.  Others
contain dragon's claws, giant's eyes, rabbit's ears and other body parts of
different monsters.

Apocalypse Loft~
This plush palacial room is at the very top of the Ancient Tree.
Only the highest level Riders are allowed in here. You can see portraits
of the original Horsemen on the wall: Merlyk...DEATH of the Apocalypse,
Pell...Pestilence of the Apocalypse, Tarod...FAMINE of the Apocalypse,
and the mighty dragon Hamlet...WAR of the Apocalypse.
  The magical restorative properties of this loft are obvious. Just being in
the room makes you feel more refreshed and mentally agile. The black velvet
couches beckon you to rest on them, and the serving wenches are at your beck
and call.

forest Haon-Dor view~
Through the tree crowns, you see fellow adventurers walking around in the
forest, gathering mushrooms, eating blackberries, committing rabbit genocide
and generally having a good time.
~
E
plate~
The transparent bronze plate looks quite strange, but the engraved letters are
quite easy to read, nevertheless :-
 
              Quifael's Virtual Balcony
 
                   Do not lean out!
 
  Please do not try to attract the attention of any
      adventurers in the forest, as you are not
         really in existence at the moment.
 
        (This could possibly mess up Reality,
      and we wouldn't want to do that, would we?)
~
E
balcony railing~
Quite transparent, but visible anyway, because of the blue glow that surrounds
the whole place.

Rope bridges~
It is here, standing on the stable rope bridge, that you realize
that this truly is the perfect sanctuary. You dream of crushing victories
over foes, of outlasting hopeless sieges laid upon this eternally beautiful
place, and of the celebrations afterwards. You arrive in the center of the
three rope bridges, a guard tower surrounding a loved tree. The forest
leaves rustle in the usual breeze and a guard casually salutes you as you
look around. The bridge west leads to the massive Ancient Tree. To the
north, the sounds of voices are resonating from a large tree house, which
is built comfortably between huge branches. The southern bridge leads to a
more fortified building, with battlements and arrow slits.

War Room~
This heavily fortified building is the last-stand-building, should
the Hall's location ever be found, and invaded. In the south-west corner
is a small hole, which leads into the tunnels.
Maps of the various area's of Boinga line the walls, and assorted battle
strategies are pinned up and traced in red on the maps. The table in
the middle is used for banquets, important meetings, war briefings and
such. It is very tidy and clean, all the papers and maps that would be on
it in times of war being stored in a cabinet near the wall.

Practice Room~
This room has been devastated all to pieces.  The room barely stands
together. The floor creaks loudly as if it were ready to give way under
your weight.  Some parts of the room are frozen, other parts are on 
fire. The walls are blackened to a crisp.  The smell of ash is strong
enough to make the most powerful faint.  This room is used as a safe
practice area.  Every harmful spell imaginable has been cast in this
room at one time.

Slither's Room~
As you enter the room you notice the bookshelves lining the walls.
Walking over to the most well-worn, you notice the theme of all of
the books.  They are books from various cultures, all showing how they
think the world will end.  However, the room is not limited to study.
Weapons of all sorts line the walls.  A roosting perch for a Dragon is in
the center of the room.
 
On the desk you spot a book.  It is a diary.  Skimming through you see
Slither's history.  He started off as a warrior, and never took his
studies seriously.  He joined the first clan that would accept him.  Due
to his inability to do anything, he invoked an old, little known
draconian spell.  It ended his life, but ressurrected him.  He started
off fresh, 17 years old once again, and took up a new profession.
Studying under Krill, he learnt both the ways of a thief, and the ways of
the Apocalypse.

You are standing in a large cherry wooden room, filled

locked into this room forever, so that future Riders may
look unto this room for inspiration, and guidance of upcoming
events that haven't yet been written.
