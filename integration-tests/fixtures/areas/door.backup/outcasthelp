-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~
Outcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They
are, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in
their lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are
a few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:

-- Attacking a fellow clan member
-- Stealing from a fellow clan member
-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan
-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership
-- Receiving a DWEEB flag
-- Spying for another Clan
-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention

Once someone has been Outcast, they may still join another clan, even
sometimes rejoining their original clan.  However, many clan leaders are
wary of those who "jump" clans a lot, eventually leaving them stranded an
Outcast forever.
