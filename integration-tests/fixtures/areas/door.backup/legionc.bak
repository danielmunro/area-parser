healer old goblin crone~
a goblin crone~
A withered old crone cackles gleefully at you.
~
This old bag has gotta be at least 200 years old. She's bald, wrinkled,
and completely insane. She randomly throws spell about the room, and
when some poor soul is hit with a combat spell, she roars with laughter.
However, she's quick-witted enough to help when needed, and will do what
she can for the Legion... at least until she goes absolutely nuts.
 
Type 'heal' for a list of spells.

Bog. beinh half-human had given him quite an advantage in intelligence, and
he uses his smarts to acquire items of power for Legion to use. And he's 
smart enough to make some money in the process.

A dark cave~
The light from the hole in the ceiling does little to brighten this cave.
Small torches are lit along the walls, but they only make the shadows deeper
rather than chase them away. The floor of the cavern is covered in muck and
slime, making your footing unsteady. Foul smells best left unknown turn your
stomach and leave you feeling dizzy. As you look around what could only be
described as a living hell, one thought enters your mind - Home sweet home.
 
The cavern continues into darkness south of you. A large crack, just big
enough for a goblin to fit through, is in the west wall.

A crack in the wall~
This crack is filled to capacity with junk. A tall goblin stands between
you and the collection of odd items. Judging from his clothing and very
large money chest, he's a peddler of some sort.

The big cave~
This huge cavern is the headquarters of Legion. The rough stone walls are
covered in graffiti of every type imaginable. The floor is covered in mud,
slime, blood, and who knows what else, sometimes to a depth of a foot. Dead
and rotting corpses are thrown every which way, some of which appear half
eaten. Broken dishes, weapons, and bones are strewn about carelessly.
 
Here and there, you can see goblins in varying states of health, from those
just sleeping to skeletons. Quite a few appear drunk to the world, while
others must be brain-dead from either alcohol or repeated beatings.
 
Staring at all this, the thought comes to you, "Did I miss the party?"

The slime pit~
This bowl-shaped room sinks to about 2 feet below the outer edges. This
depression is completely filled with some sort of ooze. The smell rising
from the gunk is horrendous, nauseating, and oh so sweet! You wade in and
find a place not occupied, or throw someone out of the way, and settle down
into the putrid slime, until just your head is above the top layer of scum.
Instantly, your body starts to tingle as the slime seeps into your pores,
healing your shattered bones and cut body, mending the punishment you've 
taken from monsters, enemies, and most of your immediate family.
 
Life couldn't get any better.

Legion portal room~
You are standing in a hot stinky section of the cave, it seems to glow
with magic. The walls are all cut smooth, and look like they are made
of obsidian. There is a very unstable looking ladder leading out
of this room, although it looks like nobody but a goblin could climb
it without having it break. Also, you notice a small sign on the north
wall, written on it some barely readable scribblings.

The Planning Room~
This part of the cave is a mess of papers and books. It looks as
though a tornado went through a library. In the center of the room 
there is a rickety looking table, made from old rotting wood.
The walls and floor are covered in filth, much like the rest of the
cave. There is an air of thought in this room, for it is where all
of the Legion's leaders come to discuss what to do about different
clan affairs.
