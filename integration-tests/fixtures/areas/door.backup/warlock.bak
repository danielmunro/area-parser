The Plane of Pure Magic~
As you float in the mists of the Clan Hall of Warlock, you wonder as to
how this could be. You are not entrapped in the cold stone walls that you
would expect to see. Somehow you have been transported to a place of pure
magical energy. All around you are swirling orbs of red, white, and black,
that seem to pulsate and writhe as though they are alive. As you stand 
amongst these orbs you can feel your body heal and your magic seems to be
growing with every second. To the east you see a portal with a dagger
encircled by a brilliant glow.

Wind Void~
You have left the sanctity of the glowing orbs, and have found yourself in
an even stranger place. You are floating in the center of a crevice. You
look down and your stomach churns, for there seems to be no end to this
pit. You feel a gust of wind pulling you down to the depths below. You
have been falling for what seems like days, before finally you come to a
halt. Weapons and armor are scattered all over the place. As you look for
an exit and there appears to be none, you grab all the equipment you may
need, for you may be here a while.

The Gathering Chamber~
This very large formal dining is often used for meetings and even
informal gatherings.  When not being used for formal functions it
serves as a nice place to get away from the constant action through
the rest of the plane.

Warlock's Advanced Magelab~
The mage lab of the Warlock clan is truly a sight to behold, the room is
immense, and crackles with the raw magical energies that are focused here.
Ancient tomes, containers, pipes, instruments from the bizarre to the mundane
fill the shelves from floor to ceiling awaiting their next user.  Large granite
tables, heat baths, and a few furnaces fill most of the floor space, only
leaving the most modest of personal space for the spellcaster.  You are certain
that even the most inept spellcaster could produce spectacular results with the
equipment and knowledge contained here.

Warlock's Practice Library~
You enter an ancient library, but, much to your surprise, you see no dust 
on any of the books.  As you look around, you discover that this is not an 
ordinary library.  There are summoning circles on the ground, following 
the exact examples shown by the open books on the tables, there are vials 
of blood, and other stranger liquids. As you take a closer look at the 
books, you notice that they were written by great mages, such as Merlin
You can't help but feel that you will learn the arts faster in this place.

Narrow Path~
You find a narrow rocky path winding away from the windy void
to the south.  To the left, steep granite walls block all access;
while on the right, mist swirls above an endless drop into nothingness.
Northward, you see a large set of oaken double-doors that are covered 
with burnt magical runes.

Portico~
You are standing in the center of a courtyard constructed from red brick and 
white mortar.  At your feet, the bricks are arranged in a pleasant wave pattern
that soothes the senses.  At the four corners, large tan earthenware pots give 
root to the large network of ivy vines that creep all over the walls.  Above,
a large skylight allows the sun to peek through the clouds giving light to
the greenery.  There are several benches arranged at just the right distance
to allow private conversations.  A large oak door shuts out the elements and 
attendant noise to the south.  A hallway leads to the north.

The wall to the right is studded with a number of oak hangers on which
are hung a variety of robes, cloaks, and pointy hats.  A small abstract 
painting, apparently a landscape on the Astral plane, hangs on the wall
to the left.  The hallway opens into the portico to the south, while
at the north it opens into the central courtyard.
