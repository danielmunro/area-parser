-1 LONER LONERS~
Loners are those who are unaligned with any particular clan, or who are
awaiting entrance into a clan.  Loners may pkill or be pkilled just as any
clan member could.  In order to become a Loner, you must be between levels
5 and 20, and you simply issue the 'loner command' giving yourself a
Loner flag.  Note that Loners have no definate safe haven, and must often
survive by the quick of their wits.
