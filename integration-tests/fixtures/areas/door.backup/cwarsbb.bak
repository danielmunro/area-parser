Emperor Vespasian~
Vespasian the Roman Emperor~
Vespasian stands here overlooking the Collosseum and the gladiators.
~
Flavius Vespasian the famous army commander and now Emperor of Rome and
creator of this great Collosseum, stands here causing you to want to bow
and worship this great man. Strong and very charismatic, you wouldn't
be able to think of such a great man as he. Ask him for help and you
will recieve, for a small price of course.

Thracius~
Thracius the Gladiator~
Thracius stands here overlooking your team's progress.
~
Thracius the renowned Gladiator stands tall, towering over you. His body
build like an olympian, sort of makes you jealous. His biceps must be over
25" as his leather band around his biceps shows signs of stretching. His 
chest is built like an ox with the pecs extruding tremendously. Thracius
looks towards you, smiles and wishes you good luck.

Samunite~
Samunite the Barbarian~
Samunite stands here over looking your team's progress.
~
Here stands one of the greatest Barbarians to live. Samunite doesn't appear
dangerous. His stomach with age has rounded and he's grown plump and chubby.
His arms and vigarous look enable him to still show signs of life in the 
arena. With his large battle axe slung on his back and the leather armour
strapped around his chest, Samunite hasn't lost the barbarian appeal.
His arms have lost size since his days of youth but still at 18" thick,
they strike fear in the opposition. He looks towards you and with his
large mouth covered by his viking beard, he speaks, "Hey there little 
one, I'ed join you on the field, but in my old age I wouldn't stand a 
chance against young lads like yourself, but here, I'ed be more then 
happy to help you out, need to buy any potions or such?".

Claw and fang marks cover the black stone walls. Entrails from the beast's 
meals have been left on the ground covering it with blood. A human's skull
lies in the corner, more then likely the beast's ex-master. The cage that
would normally keep the beast inside here has been left opened.

Clan Dallas Hall~
Here in Clan Dallas, you feel rather comfortable. Maybe it's those
magazines on the coffee table or the lazy-boy recliner you're sitting on,
but whatever it is, you're in heaven. In the corner is an antique cabinet
with a padlock to keep people like you out. Paintings of Dallas's clan life
hang on the wall, reminding him of the old days. The mini-fridge sitting
beside the recliner is stuffed with beer bottles yet to be drank and it best
stay that way. A plaque hangs on the wall telling anyone who wasn't invited
here to please leave before Dallas returns. Otherwise, you feel rather
pleasant relaxing in his lazy-boy. Just don't mess up the groove he's
worked so hard to create.
