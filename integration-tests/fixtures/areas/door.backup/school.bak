This is the direction practising room.  The possible range of directions
you can go in any room are: north, south, east, west, up or down.  Of
course, not all rooms have all exits available.
 
To see the obvious exits in a room, type: EXITS
 
Sometimes doors are closed, locked or secret.  Then you have to notice
clues in the room description, or try going into that direction and 
seeing if you bump into a door.
 
The game has some automatic settings, and one setting allows you to turn
on or off (toggle) a switch which will automatically give you a list of
obvious exits every time you enter a new room.  To turn on this automatic
setting, type: AUTOEXIT.  To see a complete list of all your automatic
settings, type: AUTOLIST.
 
You can also customize your prompt (the hitpoints/mana/movement status
information line) so it also shows you a list of obvious exits whenever
you enter a new room.  For information on this and other ways to change
and customize your prompt, type: HELP PROMPT.
 
Try going into each direction from here.  When you are done, return
to this room and go north.

Some places are water areas, and you will require either a spell of flying
or a boat of some kind to traverse.  Pick up the small raft that lies on
the ground, and float west.
 
Once you are further along in your training, you will have an opportunity 
to practise your swimming skills, to the point where you will rarely if ever
require a boat to traverse shallow water areas.

On your journeys, you will find many new objects which may be of some aid
to you.  In order to allow you to sort your items and keep your load light,
there exist a variety of containers, pouches, backpacks and satchels in
which to keep your belongings.  Some containers are even fireproof or
closable, and many can be worn upon your person to prevent theft.
 
A small leather satchel has been thoughtfully provided for you here, and
you will notice that it will both lighten your load considerably, and is
a burnproof container, keeping your potions and other goods safe from the
ravages of fire and cold.

As you can see, you had to climb a flight of stairs in order to go up from
the Centre Room.  However, some places are "in the air" as it were, and
require a spell of flying to traverse.
 
To fly like an eagle, pick up the potion o flying that lies on the ground
and type: quaff flying
 
Then just go soaring up!

Welcome to your first class in combat training.
 
The first lesson is knowing what monsters you are capable of fighting
without risking your life.  To find out whether a monster is too easy or
too difficult, type: CONSIDER <monster>  (where 'monster' is the name of
the monster).  Avoid fighting monsters that look like they can kill you
easily.
 
The second lesson is learning to run away.  There is a monster in the room
below you.  He is too strong for you to kill, but he will barely hurt you.
So go down from here, and then consider him.  Then, to attack him, type:
KILL <monster>  (you can also use: HIT <monster>).
 
     After a while, to flee from combat, type: FLEE
You can also set your character to automatically flee after you are hurt
badly enough, and to do that, type: WIMPY
(For more information about this command, type: HELP WIMPY)
 
After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
to your next class, go west.

Welcome to real combat training!  In the next couple of rooms, you will
encounter real monsters which you must fight and kill (some may even 
attack first!) without fleeing.  Kill every monster, since they all hold
a piece or two of equipment you will need later on in your journeys.
To begin combat training, go down.

You are in the healing room of the combat training area.  All around you 
are four cages.  From all around you can hear the menacing growls of
ferocious animals and the rattling of chains.  There is a big sign on the
wall.  Exits lead off into the cardinal directions, or you can go back
up the way you came.  There is also a staircase leading downwards.

Welcome to the healing room of the Combat Training area.  The adepts of
SLED Newbie School have captured some monsters for you to kill.  In the
four cages in the surrounding rooms are four monsters of various types.
Kill them all!
 
After you kill each monster, to get every item from their corpses, type:
GET ALL CORPSE.  You can then wear it all by typing: WEAR ALL
 
When you are done with the corpse, you will want to offer it up as a
sacrifice to Mojo.  Mojo rewards greatly all those who type: SACRIFICE
CORPSE.
 
Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points or
mana (magic points) faster.  You can either rest or sit, simply by typing:
REST  (or: SIT).  You can also sleep, which is more effective in healing
quickly.  However, you will not be aware of your surroundings while you
are sleeping.  To sleep, type: SLEEP.   To awaken, type: WAKE

To the south is a store.  Inside the store, you can use these commands:

After buying some food and drink, you can 'EAT' and 'DRINK' it.

you recently died and you cannot seem to reach your corpse without
dying, then type: OUTFIT.   Mojo will kindly reequip you with a basic
light, armor and weapon so you are not totally defenseless in your
quest for more money and equipment.
 
In the room north is a monster with a key that you need.  After killing
the monster and getting the key, come back here and type: UNLOCK EAST
This will unlock the locked door to the east exit, and then simply type:
OPEN EAST.  Then you can continue east to your SLED Newbie School final
examination.  Be warned, this test will be tough!  Make sure to practise

Your final examination before graduating SLED Newbie School is this:
Kill the diploma beast and take your SLED School Diploma by force!
Go north from here to visit the practice arena.  There are plenty of
low-level monsters for you to fight and gain experience from, but
unless you joing the clan sysem (by typing 'loner' or joining a clan,
read 'help clan' for more info) you will be unable to attack other players.
(which is fine for now, since you will have between levels 5 and 20 to
learn how to play the game, and decide if you wish to enter the player
killing realm *WARNING: Recommended for advanced players only*)
 
Every so often, you may wish to save your character's file because you
have advanced considerably or surmounted a particularly difficult problem
and received many experience points.  To save, simply type: SAVE.  The 
game will also routinely save your character's file, every 5-10 minutes
or so.
 
If you need more help during the game, type: HELP    There are also many
helpful fellow players on-line (to find out who's on, type: WHO) and to ask
them a question, simply type: TELL <character> <message>  (with 'character'
being the name of the person you wish to ask a question or talk to, and
'message' being what you would like to ask/say).

The Center of the Dungeon~
You are in the center of a large room.  A faint light from above shows that
the floors are all covered with slime.  A feeling of dread comes over you as
you notice that this is NOT a great place to go.  Exits go in all directions.
Of special note is the one that brings you back up!!!
