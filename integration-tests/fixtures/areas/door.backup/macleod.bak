A once perfectly carved blue crystal sphere now hovers in the dim light

tainted, and almost green.  The names and faces of Blackball and Morgana
are barely visible amist the thousands of tiny cracks along the surface
of the sphere.

The Common Room of the Once Clan Camorra~
You have entered a huge and empty hall.  The chared remains of tables, chairs
and other adornments are strewn about in piles of rubbish about the room.
A long silk banner on the northern wall is torn and also signed by a great
fire that must of destroyed all it encountered; the word 'Camorra' is barely
visible in red stich on the banner.

The Board Room~
This room was where the "big boys" of Camorra once met to make the decisions
concerning the direction Camorra would take.  It reflects the wealth the
members once shared, even in a state of destruction from the fires that 
ravaged the hall.  All of the once beautiful mahogany and cherry wood 
furniture is now destroyed, and useless.

A pair of very sinister looking skeletal warriors bar your passage to the
east.  "Only Camorra leaders may enter," the one identified as 'Crush' by
his silver collar hisses at you.  The other skeleton, 'Smash' grins evily
and knashes his teeth.

fire leather chairs~
On the southern wall, a roaring fire warms the room creating a more 
comfortable atmosphere.  The council members also use this room to relax
between meetings.  The leather chairs seem warm and inviting.
~

table~
A very wide, 10-foot black, marble table runs paralel with the pool table,
the length of the room.  Several tall, black leather chairs are arranged
neatly around the table, and on its top, you can see various ledgers, pens,
ect. the council members use to record minutes.
~
E
velvet green pool table~
Shiny, multi-colored balls are neatly organised in a triangular fashion
at one end of this antique, carved rosewood pool table.  The cue ball gleams
radiantly white in the glow of several dim, golden lamps alone the walls of
the board room.  Even though this pool table has seen a lot of use, it
is carefully maintained, and in no obvious disrepair.

Mamma's Kitchen~
This was once the feasting hall of the clan Camorra.  Long wooden tables,
and great, sturdy benches are now piled in heapes on all sides of the room.
It appears that the Camorra members made their last attempt to contain the
fire in this room in an effort to save Mamma's Kitchen.  Alas, she'll never
feed her boys spahgetti again.

The Vault~
This huge and spartan vault is the last remaining testement to Camorra.
In here, the merchants once met to rest and to count their wealth.  The walls
and cupboards are now baren, empty of all valuables.  A small plaque is the
only thing seemingly untouched by the course of the fire; it appears newly
placed.

The Inner Office~
CAMORRA is written in large, bold, golden letters on the nothern wall.  Only
leaders of Camorra could enter this room, once upon a time.  Although this
room was untouched by the fire, a search of the twin desks, and matching
shelves reveils nothing.  The names Evaldar, Morgana, Blackball, Kefka,
and Camille are chiseled in the cold stone beneith the Camorra lettering.

The Portal Room~
This room is lit only by a songle flickering torch.  The shadows dance
across the walls in ever changing patterns of light and dark.  It is from
here that the mercenaries of Camorra launch their attacks, a dark and
shadowy room that befits the secretive nature of this Clan.  Each portal
itself, appears to be no more than just another shadow on the walls.
 
There is a small sign under the torch, just barely readable in this light.
