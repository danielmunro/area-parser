-1 DWEEB~
Dweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the
gods themselves.  A Dweeb is give no safe haven, as they are allowed to be
attacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can
bestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for
a Dweeb flag:

-- Continually spamming the public channels.
-- Continually harrassing particular players.
-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.
-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.
-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.
-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.

Note that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings
before you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to
have done something truly horrendous.

Also, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the
period of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you
must live with it.
