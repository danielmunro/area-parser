plaque mandrake golden~
Mandrake, one whose vision never failed him in life.
He lived a long and prospering life, ending short in the life of an
Immortal.  His ideas, though not always feasible, were always unique.
He brought into existance the 'Temple of Elemental Evil' as a level
55 Immortal.  This area, being 200 rooms large, was the largest area
ever created by one so young in his Immortal life.
Other characters he played had great impact.  ShadowCat, once leader of
clan Honor, helped bring about many changes.  Live long, [Hunter].
QuickSilver of clan Balance took in this young Dragon Warrior, and
he became an elite Soldier, when his life was cut short.
 
We the people and Immortal of the world Boinga remember you always.
Through good times, and bad, you stood with all around you, and made
a tremendous impact on our lives.
 
At the very bottom, in very tiny letters, the sign reads:
"To my bestest friend, Mandrake.  I miss you already." -Johnwa

The Great Arch~
As you walk into a small clearing, a noticable silence has befallen the
inhabitants of these parts.  Your eyes are drawn immediately to the giant
bending trees waiting in front of you.  They look like an arch of some sort,
made out of the surrounding plant growth.  As you try to pierce the inky
blackness around you, the clearing dims further.

Inside The Arch~
As you look around you, it feels as if the trees were closing in on
themselves, to crush the life from any intruders.  As they tower above
you, the trees block your view overhead, leaving you alone, with very
meager light.  With the trees, it seems no weather could penetrate this
place, but a strong breeze flows swifty by.  The ground begins to creep
up around your ankles in a vain attempt to suck you into the marshland.
A single shrub among the many bushes stands out to the east.  You can feel
the evil in this place.

Southern Shores~
In the darkness, you can faintly make out the edge of what seems to be
a vast expanse of bog land.  Piercing the night are the shadows of 
enormous trees, the likes of which you have never seen before.  Here and
there, you catch a glimpse of a scurrying shadow, without descerning any
solid form.  Nearby, you hear the grunt of creatures that could be the
size of war horses.

see is that from small white splotches of paint on the walls.  There are
black light hanging everywhere in this room, illuminating all the white,
turning it a deep purple color.
The sound of Nine Inch Nails emits from an unknown source.
You feel like you are being watched, but you can't be sure, since it is
too dark to see anyone that might be watching you....
 
You can hear the humming of portals in the background. To get out of here:
'enter <clan name>' to head back to your clan hall.
'recall' will return you to the middle of Midgaard.

The Sleeping Hole~
You are standing in a very large hole, etched from the inside of the 
passage.  Someone, or something, very large lives here.  You spot a small
chest sitting comfortably in the corner of the room.

Cramped Passage~
This small passage makes it a bit uncomfortable to fit through.  You don't
have much of a problem getting through with a little twisting and turning.
The passageway smells of old animal and human rot.  Not a very pleasant
place to be be any means.

The Boiler Room~
This room contains a few small heating units with pipes extending through
the ceiling to an unknown destination.  It reeks of coal and an older,
mold smell.  Looking around, you can see a small hole in the floor leading
into the blackness.  It is much to hot to stay in here long.

As you step under the boilers, a blast of heat hits your body, knocking
you right to the ground.  This is when you notice that the floor is white 
hot, just as everything else is in here.  When you look back up for the
hole you entered through, you can't find it!  The white hot walls begin
to seer your flesh uncomfortably.  Time to leave before any serious

Inside The Pipe~
The pipe leads off to the north, and downwards.  It is cool, and fairly 
dirty from the old ashes lining the metal tube.  It contains an almost
entrancing mold odor.  It is a comfortable place to crawl around in, but
it doesn't seem like a place you'd want to live.  It is rather hard to 
navigate your way around the tube, but the ample light to the north gives
you a small ideea of where you are headed.
