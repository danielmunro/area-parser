Vanessa's study~
You are in a small study room.  The walls are lined with bookcases filled 
with dusty volumes of all sizes.  In the fireplace burns a crackling fire 
that makes the room warm and cozy, and in front of an oak wood reading desk 
is a large old-fashioned leather chair.

E
bookcase bookcases volume volumes book books~
Most of the books are heavy, leather-bound and covered in a thin layer of dust.
There are many titles on necromancy, bowling, and beer brewing;
but also some on computer science (although these seem to be VERY dusty
indeed) and a fair collection of horror literature, ranging from Bram Stoker
and H. P. Lovecraft to Anne Rice and Stephen King.
~
E
fireplace~
The fireplace isn't particularly big, and hasn't been used in ages.
~
E
desk~
It is very massive and seems worn from many years of use.
~
E
chair~
It is big and old-fashioned and tattered, but quite comfortable nevertheless.

Vanessa's Bondage Chamber~
You are in a room filled with shelves containing all sorts of bondage
equipment.  The walls are lined with numerous restraints, and an iron 
maiden hangs in the corner.  The air smells of leather and sweat.
A wooden ladder leads downwards.
A cracked sliding glass door opens to the porch east.

On the desk is a peculiar apparatus of glass bottles and globes connected by
small pipelines.  The green liquid inside the apparatus' globes and pipelines
is bubbling steadily.

The back porch balcony~
It turns out to be just an overdramatized iron fire escape.  The bolts are
rusting off.  The number of people that could be out here is questionable.
A cracked sliding glass door leads inside to the west.

the entire structure.

The front door~
An old oak door reinforced with wrought iron bars.  There is a small peep
hole next to the rusty door knocker.  It was truly built to keep you out.

Crash room~
All around you are burnt-out love slaves crashed anywhere they can get  
comfortable.  A few torn and smelly matresses lie about.  The smell
of urine permeates the air, and fleas jump into your hair.
