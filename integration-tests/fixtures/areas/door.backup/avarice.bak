Sister Fyria~
Sister Fyria~
Sister Fyria stands here.
~
Sister Fyria dances and chants about the fire pit. 
 
As she dances about, Sister Fyria makes magical jesters speaks in an 
ancient tongue. Her motions cause sparks and flames to leap from the fire.
She wears only a long black robe and diamond crucifix around her neck. She 
will gladly cure what ails you but would like a donation for her and her Gods.

The Entrance way to the Alcazar of the Avarice Guild~
Two rows of elaborate marble columns support the ceiling in the Entrance way.
This entrance was cut right into the side of the Wall of the Abyss. Torches are
the only light source and they alone show you the path to follow. The path leads
between the columns, east to the Abyss or north into the arms of the Guild.

The Treasure Chamber~
You have entered a large square room with exits in each direction. In the 
center of the room you see a large fire but you feel no heat coming from it. 
There is also a young Female dressed in cleric robes pacing about the room.
Upon closer inspection you can see weapons, armor and other assorted items
in the fire. Do you dare risk pulling an item from within? Perhaps you can 
ask the young female for assistance.

Aura of Rejuvenation~
Wow...What was that sensation??
There are no floors, walls or ceilings, only a White Aura of Energy
all about you.  You feel overwhelmed with energy and can't help but
lay back into the light.  As you float in the Aura, you feel your 
strength, energy and stamina returning.  It took a short time for
you to get back to tip top condition.  You can leave south, or perhaps
you can just stay here a bit longer.

The Extravagant Alcove~
This isn't a room at all. The gigantic shimmering divider is indeed
gold bullion: counted, stacked and sealed together with magic to which
there is no testimony. A glorious splendor of memorabilia, keep-sakes
and other buried treasures bring the path way to an abrupt ending.

The Gate~
A soft, starlight burns beneath your feet. There is nothing
to the north or south. A hole, blackness, dark shadows, that would
be something, but there is simply nothing.
 
A black portal swirls and pulls the willing to the ends of the dimentia.
 
A sign hangs on the wall.

Avarice's Secret Hoard~
This is the main storage room in which Avarice's riches are held.
You are almost blinded by the shimmering mounds of gems piled
floor to ceiling.  Some of the rarest items known to man or Immortal
are scattered around the room.  The mere thought of the value of
the rooms contents are mind boggling.  Theft of any of this rooms
contents will surely be your demise.  Gently place your latest
aquisition in a pile and take your leave.

A Glimmering Hallway~
The flecks of pure gold embedded in the polished granite walls sparkle
by the light of several small torches that line the hallway.  The cold
unforgiving walls echo your footsteps just as they did hundreds of
years ago.  This hallway leads to the private rooms of the most feared
and prestigious thieves and killers to ever walk the lands of Boinga.
Every doorway is framed in solid gold with a small plaque on each door
engraved with the names of all whom have occupied such a luxury.
 
There is a small plaque on the west door.

The Rogues Grotto~
The darkest midnight would seem brilliant compared to this dungeon.
Thick silver baseboards, six inches high, line the room. An intricate
vine crafted from the finest sterling spreads across the walls of the
room. Each corner possesses an eerie silence, yet you feel safe here.
 
The room is empty, save a plaque in the corner and the extravagant jewels
sparsely inset into the walls of the room. There are piles of silver, 
gold, shards and other glittering items littered about the prison.
 
The room eminates peace and tranquility from it's owner. However, it is
walls that keep you safe, not the owner. Beware: stepping outside this
room will surely result in death.

The Lair of The Berzerking Goblin~
As you enter this lair a horrible stench assails your nostrils as you look 
around in the darkness you begin to realize what is causing the horrible 
stench,mounds and mounds of corpses,body parts,and refuse are strewn about
the room in what seems to have been an orgy of destruction. As you take a 
few steps within the room you begin to feel a liquid drip down onto your 
head, you fear looking up but you know you must to see what it is that is 
dripping onto you,as you look up you see the most shocking thing you have 
ever seen it seems a large cow is being suspended from ceiling in some sort
of magical manner. As you take a final glance around the room you realize,
what ever being lives here must not be a person you would like to meet,
especially if you've entered this room without his permission. So with 
that,either get out,or prepare to die if caught within and have your corpse
added to the pile.

The Idiot Stick King's Bedroom~
As you walk into this small room you have to cover your mouth to
stop from puking. This place is a pig sty, with garbage all over
the floor, and rotting food stuck to the walls. There is a toilet
in the center of the room, with pieces missing and holes all over.
The floor is soaking wet with water from the toilet As you walk towards 
the back of the room you become lost in all the garbage. A monster 
jumps out of the filth and pukes in your hair. All of a suddan Borb,
the Idiot Stick King jumps in front of you and cuts open the belly 
of the monster, spilling guts all over the floor. Borb laughs at 
the monster and then leaves it to rot with the rest of his possesions, 
and leaves the room chuckling to himself.

Behind the Aura of Rejuvenation~
You have entered a small passage which is hidden
extremely well behind the glowing Aura of Rejuvenation.
This small passage has been cut right through the walls
of an Abyss making it even harder to find it's entrance.
You can see that the main passage continues to the north 
and the small side passages leads off to the sidestreets 
of Boinga.
