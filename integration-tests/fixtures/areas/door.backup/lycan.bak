Signs proclaiming leather goods, weapons, armour, and other items swing
slowly from their hinges in the dank air.  However, it is clear even from
here that the shops have been completely ruined and looted.  Large gashes
marr the doors and walls of once fancy shops.
The road continues west where you can see a building that looks in better
repair or you can go back east towards the main street.

Street in Lycanthropia~
The road turns here and you have your choice of continuing north or east.
Towards the north you can see a large house standing, intact, amongst the
ruins of other buildings.  A little ways to the east what looks like an
Inn is visible through the light fog that swirls here.

Outside the Manor~
Continuing down the street you come to a magnificent Manor house.  Oddly,
it is one of the only buildings you have seen that hasn't begun to 
collapse.  Perhaps there is something or someone important inside.
Instead of entering the house you can continue north or south along the road.

Outside Pooh's House~
You have come to a large intersection.  You can continue in all four
directions from here.  To the west seems to be some kind of a house.  It
is in a little better shape then most of the other buildings you have seen.
Towards the south you can see a large magnificent house that appears to be
completely intact.  The road continues north and west.

Lupus Lane~
A smaller road, then the streets you have been walking, starts here.  It 
looks like this was once a residential area.  Many small houses lined the
street at one point.  Now, the are mostly ruined and collapsed.  It's
hard to imagine anything could live here at all anymore.  Yet, you continue
to hear strange sounds coming from the destroyed houses.  You probably
shouldn't linger here to long.

Lupus Lane~
Continuing along the residential street you are now surrounded by half
destroyed houses.  The three and four story buildings lining both sides of
the street have, in some places, collapsed onto one another.  This gives
the street the appearence of a strange tunnel.  You are glad you have a 
light source to get through here, because strange sounds can sometimes be
heard within the ruined houses.
It seems to be a bit lighter to the west or you can head back to the
start of the residential district towards the east.

Behind the Manor~
You are behind a large, nice looking house.  There is a small door here
that must have been used for deliveries and as a staff entrance.  It is
iron-bound and strong looking.  Perhaps one of the servants left it 
unlocked.  If you don't want to enter the house you can go north or
south into the alley.

Rat Lair~
You have entered a truly bizarre cave.  Strange blue algae gives off enough
illumination to light the area.  The first thing that catches your eye is
a large tapestry on the north wall.  It depicts a terrible rat-like face
with huge, blood-stained teeth and glaring, beady little eyes.  It is more
than a little disturbing.  Set into the wall, under the tapestry, is what
appears to be some sort of altar.  It too looks blood stained.
The only other exit seems to have been blocked by a rock fall.  It looks
like you will have to retreat back up the stairs to the alley.

almost to splinters.   From here you can go west or south into the house

Once a gigantic table took up most of this room.  Now, it is a huge pile
of firewood (although it is nice firewood).  The rest of the room is 
decorated with tapestries and pictures of various woodland scenes.  The
affect is, or would have been, quite nice if it wasn't for the blood
stains covering most of the art.  Exits lead east and south to other
parts of the house or stairs lead up to the second floor.

He might be here so you can find out for yourself.

Yanni, Barney and other known evil-doers hang from ropes suspended from

box lying on the rocks to the south.  The only other way out seems to be

walls glisten softly in the candle light.  The candles are held by 
gargoyle wall sconces.  Their eyes glitter and their wings appear to 
flutter as if they are trying to escape the polished, black basalt
which lines the centre of the walls.  Marble benches form rows to each
side of the room.  A golden chandelier casts halos accross the walls. 
An ornate altar of gold sits at the end of the room.  A chalice burning
incense sits on each side.  Wisps of smoke drift up to the majestic
image of Mojo.  A gurgling fountain springs from each of Mojo's open 
palms.  His left hand cradles one of pure clean water, the other hand
holds a fountain of wine.  This room is filled with his presence and
his blessing.

You quickly survey the vast room and find no visible exits.  The walls are
lined with bookshelves containing tomes of arcane magicks.  In the centre
of the room, you see an orchestral pit with instruments hovering in 
mid-air.  On the north wall, a black marble fireplace is blazing with a 
large fire, heating Handel's entire study.  On the mantle, you see a 
fluffy white cat that hisses at you when you look in her direction.
A mahogany couch is located in front of the fireplace, beckoning
you to rest you weary feet.
