The Path to the Forbidden City~
You stand in the midst of a dense, humid jungle. A sign nearly
covered with thick underbrush says, "Welcome to Eastern Boinga" in
several unusual languages. In the distance to the north you see a
glorious walled city with strange activity surrounding it. To the
west you see a small path leading deeper into the dark, oppressive
jungle. The strange noises of unknown animals intensifies and the
heat threatens to overwhelm you.

Deep in the Swamp~
You have entered a dark, swampy part of the jungle. The canopy of
trees overhead virtually blocks out all the sunlight. The ground is
very marshy, and soaks your feet through your boots as you walk.
The horrid stench of decaying vegetation and flesh permeates
everywhere. Inhuman cries of rage and animal aggression send
shivers up your spine. The path through the jungle ends in the
deepest, murkiest part of the swamp.

A Clearing Before the Great Wall~
You follow the path through the jungle into a clearing. As you near
the walled city, you marvel at its construction. The enormous walls
are built to withstand the most intense of sieges, and beyond the
walls are spectacular buildings, unlike any you have ever seen
before. The tall pagodas inside the walls seem to have been made
from solid gold.
  You also get a closer view of the activity surrounding the city..
it would seem an army is indeed trying to lay siege. The noise of
fighting and death becomes almost deafening as you near the city
walls.

At the Great Wall~
As you near the wall you see a large group of colorfully dressed
soldiers preparing for an upcoming battle. The armor and dress of
the soldiers is highly unusual. Unlike the common warriors of the
rest of Boinga, these men wear armor that seems almost ridiculously
light, as if it would scarcely protect them from a single blow.
Judging from the behavior of the soldiers, it's obvious they have
complete faith in their abilities, however. Near the soldiers
stands a sorry-looking man, evidently a spellcaster of some sort.
  Looking at the wall, it is high, very solid-looking, and
practically impenetrable, you decide. Unless there were a secret
entrance of some sort no one has found yet..

You are now inside the walls of the Forbidden City. In contrast to

All around you, you hear the chanting of religious disciples. You
assume they are praying to save their temples from the heathen
rabble pounding on their protective barriers.

about, preparing to defend their citadel. Clerics hasten to
positions where their spells will have maximum effect on the forces
outside the walls.
  To the east, you hear the chanting of monks and clerics coming
from the inside of a lavish pagoda. To the west, you see a smaller,
unremarkable looking building.

As you enter the pagoda, you see rows upon rows of monks chanting,
praying to their gods for salvation from the hordes threatening
their temples. Very few of them bother looking up from their
contemplations to notice you intruding on their holy place. You
notice what they focus their attention on: a large golden altar,
inscribed with dozens of chants and litanies to various gods.

You stand in the middle of a busy intersection in the City. People
hustle and bustle about you, some conducting their everyday
business seemingly unaware of the threat outside the walls, while
others frantically scramble to defensive positions.
  To your east is a smaller temple which seems uninhabited. To the
west is a plain looking brick building, and to your north lies a
thick walled building with occasional snarls and flashes of
brilliant white light emanating from it.

than the others. The sleeping mat on the floor has at least a half
inch of padding to comfort its user, the hearth has a ready supply
of wood at hand, and a low table keeps the inhabitant from having
to eat off the floor. A very important person must be staying here

here is to be freed when all other resistance has proven useless.
It will then destroy both the invaders and the City itself,
insuring its lasting security. The monks guarding the dragon
nervously give it plenty of room as it snarls viciously at them.

The Decorated Passage~
The passage takes an abrupt turn here. The further you get inside
the holiest of tombs, the more detailed and intricate the paintings
and religious symbolism on the walls become. The colors in the
paintings on this part of the tombs almost seems to make the
landscapes and ancient historical figures come to life before your
very eyes. Ahead the walls seem to glow with an inner light.

The Swamp~
The miasmic swamp begins to thin out gradually as you follow the
path. You feel the ground under your feet begin to become more
solid as you continue. To the north and south you see thick patches
of tall brown grass.
