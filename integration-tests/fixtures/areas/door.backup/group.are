#HELPS

4 LEVELFOUR~

Notice: Your name is not approved by the Immortals yet. You will not gain
any experience from anything you kill until your name has been approved, 
you therefore will not be able to level past level 4 until you speak with
an Immortal. We regret this delay in your leveling. Have a nice Day!
~

9 LEVELNINE~

Notice:  Once you have advanced beyond level 10, some of the game rules
change for you.  In particular, you will no longer receive automatic free
spells from the various healers, and you won't be able to use the recall
command anymore.  The only way to recall will be with deity gifts or the
'word of recall' spell.  Be prepared!

SEE: 'word of recall' 'deity'
~

10 LEVELTEN~

Notice:  This is the last level at which you will be able to recall with
the 'recall' command, and also that last at which the healers will attend to
your needs for free!  Be prepared!  The size of your equipment will also now
come to bear on your gaming strategy.  Some armor is sized for specific
sizes of creatures, and can only be made to fit via the use of the 'warp' 
spell.

SEE: 'word of recall' 'warp'
~

11 LEVELELEVEN~

Congratulations!  You have gotten beyond the learning stages of MHS.  From
this point on, the game system will not hold your hand any longer.  You
will have to pay for use of the healer, you will need to warp your equipment
to fit you, and you will need to save your sac points wisely, as the recall
command will not work for you anymore.  Good luck!  If you haven't clanned
yet but would like do, make sure you do so before level 21 or you'll never
be able to.

~

20 LEVELTWENTY~

NOTICE:  This is the last level at which you will be able to join the clan
system. If you do not loner or join a clan before leveling to level 21 you
will not be able to do so after.

SEE: 'clan' 'loner'
~
-1 GRENADE~
Syntax: grenade <grenade> <target>

   All classees are equally capable of using grenade weapons.  Different 
grenades may or may not have different affects on their targets.  Only
grenade items may be thrown at your targets.  Grenades may not be used 
while in combat.
~

-1 ALCHEMY ALCHEMIST~
  Alchemy is the art of creating magical potions.  Those with the Alchemist
kit may create one of the following 6 potions.

   1. Accuracy         - helps you hit things better
   2. Magic Resistance - makes spells less likely to hurt you
   3. Vision           - helps you see secret things, and even faded 
			 nethermancers
   4. Restoration      - restores a small amount of magical energy
   5. Speed            - reduces the delay on your actions
   6. Molotov Cocktail - a weapon with which to smite your foes

You must be carrying sufficient gold to purchase the ingredients, and be
in a magelab to make use of the alchemy skill.  The cost of the potion is 
automatically deducted from your gold when you brew the potion.

Molotov cocktails have a colour associated with them.  Each colour
is indicative of a specific damage type.  It is up to you to determine
which colours give which type of damage.

SEE ALSO: grenade brew
~

-1 BREW~
syntax: brew <accuracy|resist|vision|mana|speed|molotov>

Note: You must spell out the full name of the potion you wish to brew.
      I.E. brew molotov NOT brew molo
~

-1 WYRMSLAYER~
Available to:  Any non-dragon

    Wyrmslayers really don't like dragons.  No, you don't understand.
They *REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like dragons, and this is more than your
run-of-the-mill anti-lizard sentiment.  The Wyrmslayer spends his or her
life dedicated to the destruction of dragons, and so all Wyrmslayers are
given {Cdagger{x and {Cspear{x, just to make sure they've got the tools of
the trade.  On top of that, Wyrmslayers are expert at getting their weapons
through those damned dragon scales, and getting their spells past the
dragon's natural magical resistance.  Due to their extreme hatred of dragons,
the Wyrmslayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal damage to the
lizards.  This is not a special skill, but an inate ability that depends
solely on the Wyrmslayer's level.
~

-1 BUFFY SLAYER~
Available to:  Any non-remort

    Slayers really don't like undead.  No, you don't understand. They 
*REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like remorts, and this is more than your
run-of-the-mill anti-dead-guy sentiment.  Due to their extreme hatred 
of remorts, the Slayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal 
damage to the undead.  This is not a special skill, but an inate 
ability that depends solely on the Slayer's level.
~

-1 BISHOP~
Available to:  Cleric Paladin Crusader

    The Bishop is a leader, and supreme spellcaster.  They do not cast
their spells, they access their magic through the use of the {Choly chant{x.
Bishops receive enhanced mana gains, and have the ability to cast all of their
spells while in combat.  Bishops also receive an extra 100 sac points, and
cast their spells as a slight reduction in mana cost.

NOTE: All Bishops should save at least two practices for 'holy chant' if 
they wish to avoid being crippled in the spellcasting arena.

SEE ALSO:  'holy chant'
~

-1 'HOLY CHANT' CHANT~
Syntax: chant <spell> <target>

    The chant command is used exactly like the 'cast' command.  The major
difference is that the Bishop has a skill percentage with 'chant', and  it
is checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills
that must be at an adequate level: 'holy chant', and the spell being chanted.
It is advised that all Bishops save at least two practices for 'holy chant'
before they take this kit.
~

-1 NINJA~
Available to:  Thief Assassin Rogue

    The ninja is the ultimate stealth machine, specializing in two unique
abilities.  {CNinjitsu{c, and {CKurijitsu{x.  The Ninja also can sneak out 
of combat, and know which way he went.

SEE ALSO: ninjitsu  kurijitsu
~

-1 NINJITSU~
Syntax: automatic

    Ninjitsu is the art of concealment, and adept practioners are completely
impossible to detect when using ninjitsu incombination with standard stealth-
related skills.
~

-1 KURIJITSU~
Syntax: automatic

    Kurijitsu is the art of strategically placing your attacks on an   
opponent.  Skilled practioners of kurijitsu can do incredible amounts of
damage with a single standard attack.  One must be very skilled in kurijitsu
to fully realize its potential.
~

-1 PROPHET~
Available to:  Cleric Monk Paladin Crusader

    Of all the religious kits, the Prophet by far is the closest to his
deity.  Prophets are the specially chosen ones, who communicate most 
clearly and directly to their gods.  Consequently, they have the ability
to call upon their faith to {Cimbue{x themselves with enhanced spellcasting
abilities.  Furthermore, due to their closeness to their deities, Prophets
receive an extra practice any time they level.  Finally, Prophets improve
their skills much more quickly than others through manual practice.

SEE ALSO: imbue
~

-1 IMBUE~
Syntax: cast 'imbue'

    The 'imbue' spell is a special part of the Prophet kit, and raises the
Prophet's casting level.  The amount of the raise depends on the Prophet's
class.
~

-1 VINDICATOR~
Available to:  Cleric Crusader
               All races

    The Vindicator is the most militant of religious figures, with a hardy
frame, and a strong swordarm.  Vindicators are combat-oriented, and tough,
not to mention well atuned to the aspets of their gods that provide them  
with the most strength: anger.  Vindicators are the only clerics that  
receive the {Cthird attack{x skill, and also have the ability to cast a 
unique spell that invokes the {Cwrath{x of their gods.

SEE ALSO: wrath
~

-1 WRATH~
Syntax: cast 'wrath' <victim>

	The spiritual Wrath of the gods can be invoked and cast upon
anybody (barring clan/non-clan restrictions) at the will of the 
Vindicator.  The spell has the potential to do enormous damage, even more
so if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods
leaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this
powerful spell on the next succesful casting.  The Vindicator must be in
good standing with his or her deity for this spell to have its maximum
effect.

~

-1 BARBARIAN~
Available to:  Warrior Berzerker
               All races

   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal
rage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian
has two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian
rage{x.  Both fit into the Barbarian's style of "hurt now, ask questions
later, if there's anything left to interrogate."
~

-1 ENDURANCE~
Syntax: automatic

   The Endurance skill causes the barbarian to take less damage when he is 
injured.  This includes weapon and magical damage, and it even will reduce
damage taken from attacks like backstabs, bites, and damage types that the
barbarian is vulnerable too.  The amount of reduction is random, but it can
be as high as 30%.
~

-1 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~
Syntax: automatic

   The barbarian's rage is a unique type of berserk attack.  It kicks in
automatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better
the chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian
is in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.
Because the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some
regard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.
~

-1 POQUAH PROWLER~
Poquah and Prowler... Can't get much smoother than this. Now you know where
the 'Roxbury' social comes from.
~

-1 'KIT'~

Q. What is a 'kit'?
A. A kit is a special collection of new game mechanics and/or abilities that
are available to specific classes.

Q. What are the benefits of taking a kit?
A. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you
have a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit
you have.

Q. What is the downside?
A. You -must- pay trains to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.

Q. Which kits are available for my class?
A. See 'help kit list'.

Q. Can I take multiple kits?
A. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change
kits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For
example, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit
you will loose your old enchanting abilities.

Q. Can I trade my kit back in for the trains I spent on it?
A. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.

Q. How do I accept a kit?
A. Type 'kit take <name>'

Q. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!
A. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.

Q. It says I don't have good enough attributes!
A. Your -natural- attributes have to meet the minimum required for the kit.

Q. How do I tell what the minimums are?
A. Type 'kit info <name>'

Q. If I remort, do I loose my kit?
A. No, unless you were a vampire hunter and remort into a garou :)

Q. If I reclass, do I loose my kit?
A. Yes.

Some suggestions that you needn't bother with:
    Do not suggest 'balance' things ("If class X has 6 options, so should
    class Y!"  "If there is a dwarf-only kit there should be a faerie-only
    kit too!").  Do not suggest overly specific things.  A 'knight' kit
    would be ok.  A 'yinnish knight' or 'elven archer' or 'elf scribe' is
    too specific.  Complaining about the availability of a given kit will not
    get you anywhere.  Neither will complaining about the lack of kits for
    a given race or class.  We add them as we can.  If there aren't any or
    enough in your mind for a specific type of character, I don't want to 
    hear about it.

The following are ideas being considered for future kits.  But, don't get
your hopes up.

sacrificed enough of your kills to your deity and your alignment is
appropriate for your deity.  Or, for a cost of 2 sac points, you can

~
-1 REMORT~
REMORTS
Syntax: remort <garou|nosferatu|mummy>

The transformation is PERMANENT, you will not be given a chance to go
back.  To become a remort type: remort <selection> picking one of the 
valid remorts.  You will then be transformed and forced to quit out 
of the game.  REMEMBER, this is something to do if you get bored at level 
51.  It is NOT intended to make you necessarily better than anyone else, 
just different.  If remorts are "better" then they deserve it.

When you come back, all remorts will have the following affects:
You will be level 25.
You will have lost 26 levels of experience.
If you did not use all your trains you will be forced to train
hitpoints, then...           (HINT: use them or lose them)
You will have lost 1/2 of the hp,mana and moves you gained since creation.
All skills you had over 75% will be down to 75%.
The clan, race, class and skill/spell groups you had will NOT change.

The new benefits and disadvantages you will have can be found in the
individual help files, see HELP GAROU, HELP NOSFERATU and HELP MUMMY.
~

-1 GAROU~

Garou
-----
additions
bite skill:  damages your opponent and infects their blood
             only in combat, can not initiate combat
morph skill: parry better, dodge better, fight hand to hand better
             backstab with your claws (if you have backstab)

disadvantages
At certain times of day and with under conditions you will not heal at 
tick, but in fact will take damage for being out of your "element".  You 
will be more vulnerable to weapons made of a certain material.  You will 
not be able to cancel out of a morph.

For more information on Remorts, see HELP REMORT.
~
-1 NOSFERATU~

Nosferatu
---------
additions
bleed skill: damages your opponent, you gain 1 point of mana
             for every 2 points of damage they take
entrance spell:  cast 'entrance' <victim> <what you want them to do>
                It's like a 1 command charm and has the same rules
                as ordering a charmie

disadvantages
At certain times of day while outdoors you will not heal at tick, but
in fact will take damage for being out of your "element".  You will be
vulnerable to weapons made of a certain material.

For more information on Remorts, see HELP REMORT.
~
-1 MUMMY~
Mummy
-----
additions
breathe skill: damages your opponent and infects their blood
               only in combat, can not initiate combat
fear skill: causes your opponents to flee in fear
hex skill: lay the curse of the ages on your opponents
           only in combat, can not initiate combat
regeneration: regenerate at an accelerated pace
resistances: receive less damage from non-flame weapons

disadvantages
At certain times of day and with under conditions you will not heal at
tick, but in fact will take damage for being out of your "element".  You
will be more vulnerable to weapons made of a certain material. A Mummy
is naturally no the best mover, so they receive less moves per level.

For more information on Remorts, see HELP REMORT.
~

-1 GOBLIN~
Goblins are a mutant race, decended long ago from humans.  They
are slightly more nimble than humans but a bit less hearty.  Goblins
have glowing red eyes and due to their awful diets are resistant
to disease and poison.  Suprisingly they make better spellcasters 
than they do fighters.  

~
-1 LASHER~
Lasher are related to giants but with slightly lower strength and
slightly higher intelligence, wisdom, and dexterity. They are a  
demonic race and are not best suited for any one particular class.
They are quite resiliant so they get fast healing and meditation for free 
and being born of the storm are resistant to the damage of lightning
and fire. They are quite vulnerable to mental attacks.
~

-1 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.  

Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so
are very vulnerable to drowning.  All dwarves receive berserk, regardless
of class, and can see in the dark with infravision.
~ 
0 DRAG~
Syntax: drag <victim> <direction>
        drag <object> <direction>

You can drag an object from one room to another, assuming
you have the moves to do so. The object must be either
a takeable or a draggable object.

You can drag a person from one room to another, assuming
you have the moves to do so. The person must be in a prone
position of some sort and can not be an aggressive monster.
Anyone can drag monsters around. Only Clanners can drag
other players around, and then only other clanners.
~

-1 DRAGON DRAGONS~
Dragons are those big scaley creatures. They may become very powerful as 
they grow.  They have infrared vision and fly naturally.  They receive 
enhanced damage, and hand to hand combat skills for free, and naturally 
their breath is dangerous.  They are very costly to play in both time 
spent and experience needed as a trade off to their power. 
~

-1 GARGOYLE~
Gargoyles are unliving animated stone creatures.  They are born of the
night, and as such, they suffer damage during the sunlight as remorts
do.  Gargoyles cannot escape this torment, even when indoors.  During
the night, Gargoyles gain resistance to some types of damage.  But
during the day, that resistance becomes a vulnerability.  They are
medium sized and can excel at any class.  They can fly, see in the
infrared spectrum, and have an inate ability to see invisible.
~

-1 ROCKBITER~
Rockbiters are gigantic creatures who are made of and thrive off of 
rocks and minerals.  They are the largest of all the races, and are 
thick and resiliant.  Their major weakness is that they are slow
of movement.  Although their minds are relatively keen, they are
prone to fall victim to mental attacks.  Although they are not very
wise when young, they gain wisdom with age.
~

-1 FAERIES~
Faeries are tiny little winged creatures, with great vision and perception.
They can all fly, see in the dark, and even detect invisible and hidden
creatures.  They are the best spellcasters of any of the races in terms
of sheer magical prowess, but they have horrible strength and low hit points.
They are difficult to maladict, but they are incredibly agile and dodge
better than any other race.  They also receive the dodge skill for free.
~

-1 MUTANTS~
Mutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that
vaguely resembles humans, but they will, at random times, mutate into other
races.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,
size, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes
change as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain
that knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no 
control over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP
depending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority
of their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not
a race for the impatient or inexperienced.  Your results will vary wildly from
those of other mutants.
~

-1 ELF ELVES~
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.

Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
Because they are notoriously hard to spot, and so all elves, regardless of 
class, may use sneak and hide.
~

-1 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALF~
Half-elves are decendents of the Elven race, yet along the way, they
strayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness
outside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from
humans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly
exact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability
to sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),
but they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly
as a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark
like their forefather elves.
~

-1 VOLARE~
Volare are a race of angelic creatures, decended from the heavens from
the eyes of Mojo.  As he wept, they were created.  Volare, being good
of nature, resist the powers of light, while are crippled by the powers
of darkness.  With their natural abilities, they were given the nature
to help mortals through creation, cures, and defend themselves through
combat.
~

-1 YINN~
   The Yinn are a race of bipedal canines.  They hail from a frigid area
of ice and storms, and so are resistant to cold and electricity.  However,
little is known of their weakness, save that they do not like heat due
to their natural climate, and area of origin.  They are a fairly intellegent
race, with an internal code of discipline and honor.  Even still, they have
short tempers, and quick swords, and do not hesitate to solve a problem
through combat.  Yinn excel at most anything they do.  They are quite
vicious.
~

-1 KENDER~
Kender are related to elves but with slightly higher strength, dexterity
and constitution.  They lack a bit in wisdom and significantly in
intelligence.  They are born thieves, too fidgety for other professions.
Being so so nimble they get the dodge skill for free and are resistant
to being bashed.  Being so tiny they are more vulnerable to cold and
poison.
~

-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may
also train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.
~

Choice (add,drop,list,help)?~

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~
The MHM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60    2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000

be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

-1 ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~

-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~

-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~

-1 RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~

-1 TRIP~
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~

-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~

-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~

-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

-1 LORE~
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~

-1 PEEK~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 COMMUNION~
A skill unique to clerics, the communion skill allows the cleric to convert
his or her past offerings to his/her deity into hit points or mana.  The
use of communion is automatic, and is done when the cleric attempts to
cast a spell without having enough mana, or is attacked and does not have
enough hit points to survive the hit.
~

-1 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~

-1 CHI~
This skill is the art of controling your life force.  When control total
control of your chi is acheived movement costs can be cut in half.
~
-1 'DETECT GOOD' 'DETECT EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'detect good'
        cast 'detect evil' 
	
These spells enable the caster to detect good and evil characters. Good 
reveals a golden aura and Evil reveals a red aura. Casting of either of
these spell will reveal both good and evil, it is not necessary to cast
both upon yourself.
~

-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~


-1 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~

-1 'DEMONFIRE'~
Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~

-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~

-1 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

-1 'NEXUS'~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~

-1 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~

-1 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~

-1 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~

-1 CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~

-1 HASTE~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~

-1 FEAST~
Syntax: cast 'feast' <target>

The 'feast' spell is sort of like casting a magic mushroom inside of
the belly of your intended target.  Feast will fill up any creature, be
it living, dead, or undead.  There are times, however, when a given
creature doesn't -wish- to be full.  If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,
he or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.
~

-1 FAMINE~
Syntax: cast 'famine' <target>

The 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains
sustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and 
food, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the
'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be
hungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always
succeed.
~

-1 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~

-1 PLAGUE~
Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.  Willfully spreading
plague around and among other players is generally frowned upon, and if you
do not take responsibility for your sickness and cure yourself, you may
find yourself the subject of the wrath of the immortals.
~

-1 'CREATE ROSE'~
Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~

-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL' 'PROTECTION NEUTRAL'~
Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
        cast 'protection good' <target>
	cast 'protection neutral' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry more then one defense at 
the same time.
~

0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~

-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~

-1 FARSIGHT~
Syntax: cast 'farsight'
  cast 'farsight' <direction>

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~

-1 MASS HEALING~
Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~

-1 'FLOATING DISC'~
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~

-1 FIREPROOF~
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
  alias <word>
  alias <word> <substitution>
  unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
~

-1 PSIONICS~
The psionic group is a group of mental energy spells.

The following spells are available in the Psionics group:

'psionic blast'      - does mental damage to the victim and some back to
                       the spellcaster

'body weaponry'      - turns your hands into weapons and your skin to armor
'lay on hands'       - drains life away from the caster and gives it to

                       more life than the caster has to give
'mirror image'       - your opponent begins fighting something they think
                       is you, giving you time to escape
~

-1 'PSIONIC BLAST' PSIBLAST~
Syntax: cast 'psionic blast' <victim>

A Psionic Blast will do damage to your victim based on your level,
intelligence and constitution.  It will also do a fraction of that
damage back to you.

Once protected by the Tower of Iron Will the caster becomes resistant
to mental attacks.

Bringing down the wrath of the gods, the Crusader can stop his
opponent from moving with this spell.  The victim is prevented from
walking anywhere and is unable to use his or her skills,spells or
abilities. If the held person is attacked, the spell fails.
~

-1 'ENDURE HEAT' 'ENDURE COLD'~
Syntax: cast 'endure <heat|cold>' <target>

This spell, castable only by Crusaders, blesses the target with
resistance to cold- or heat-based attacks.  It only works on creatures
that do not already have sort of innate resistance or vulnerability to
these attacks.  It won't, for exmaple, work on a dragon to counter their
vulnerability to cold.
~

-1 'AID'~
Syntax: cast 'aid' <target>

The Crusader can temporarily increase his or her maximum hit points, or
those of a companion through the use of the aid spell.  The increase is
a fraction of the target's maximum hit points.
~

-1 'INFILTRATE'~
Syntax: automatic

The infiltrate ability allows rogues to enter private or solitary rooms
even while they are occupied.  Additionally, infiltrate can also be used
to enter guilds to which the rogue does not belong.  Lastly, infitrate
can allow the rogue to pick up objects without being seen by others in
the room.

~

-1 WIZARD~

as mages do.  The Wizard is the best enchantor in the land, as well has
having access to a handful of choice spells.  In the illusion group, the
Wizard receives blur.  In the maladictions group he finds 'feeblemind' 'forget'
and 'fumble'.  In transportation, 'knock', and in Necromancy, 'enervation'.
See the individual helpfiles on these spells for more information.
~

-1 BLUR~
Syntax: cast 'blur' <target>

The blur spell is part of the illusion group, but is accessible only to
Wizards.  It improves the wizards armor class, while also making it easier
for him or her to dodge incoming attacks.  It can be cast on others as well.

Syntax: cast 'knock' <direction>
        cast 'knock' <object>

The knock spell is the Wizard's skeleton key.  It allows him to break open
sealed doors, whether they are locked by key or by magic.  This spell does
not always, succeed, however, and is subject to some of the same limitations
as the thief's 'pick lock' ability.
~

-1 FUMBLE~
Syntax: cast 'fumble' <target>

The fumble spell makes the victim clumsy and awkward, lessing his or her
ability to defend himself and stay on his or her feat.  Victims of the 
fumble spell will drop weapons, trip when walking, fall over when trying to
dodge, and basically be a total clutz.  They're also easier to bash.
~

-1 FORGET~
Syntax: cast 'forget' <victim>

The forget spell erases pieces of the victim's memory, forcing him or her
to rely on instinct instead of knowledge and experience.  The victim of
the powerful 'forget' spell will find that his or her skills work at a
lower level.
~

-1 FEEBLEMIND~
Syntax: cast 'feeblemind' <victim>

rips apart his or her ability to reason.  It also reduces their willpower
and makes it easier for the Wizard to land subsequent spells.

Syntax: cast 'enervation' <victim>

One of the most powerful of Necromantic magicks, the enervation spell snuffs
out the life force of the victim.  It causes him or her to cast all spells

but victims with high wisdom tend to suffer less.

target is attacked any time during the duration of the spell, all members of

opponent's armor and do mean, painful things.  It is one of the Elementalist's
few major offensive attacks, and can damage all of the Elementalist's enemies
at once.  It always ignores his/her friends.
~

-1 'FLAME SHIELD' 'FROST SHIELD' 'ELECTRIC SHIELD'~
Syntax: cast 'flame shield'
	cast 'frost shield' 
	cast 'electric shield'

These shields surround the Elementalist with a protective aura from
the specific element. The shields absord damage of the element from
weapons, but not from spells.  It also doubles the chances that the
spellcaster's equipment will survive an attack, be it from weapon
or breath. Only one element shield may be surrounding the Elementalist
at any one time.

Note: Flame Shield does not counter the {Cheat metal{x spell.
~

-1 'ELECTRICSWORD' 'FLAMESWORD' 'FROSTSWORD'~
Sytax: cast 'electricsword' <weapon>
       cast 'flamesword' <weapon>
       cast 'frostsword' <weapon>

Fire and Element Water respectively.  These spells will imbue a
weapon with a power from the Plane.  The weapon must be in the

of his health for a short time.
~

-1 MISTFORM 'MIST FORM'~
Syntax: cast 'mistform'

This air spell makes the caster insubstantial, and improves his/her armor
class.  It also has the ability to prevent attacks from landing at all,
though this ability breaks down the mistform spell quickly, causing it to
wear off more rapidly.
~

-1 'DUST STORM'~
Syntax: cast 'dust storm' <victim>

The sphere of Elemental Air contributes the 'dust storm' spell to the
Elementalist's inventory of attacks.  This versatile spell summons forth
a storm of debris, dust, and dirt towards his/her enemy.  The storm can
render the victim sightless, as well as anybody the victim is grouped
with.  The storm will always ignore members of the spellcaster's own
group.

Syntax: cast 'wall of wind' <victim>

Hailing from the sphere of Elemental Air, the 'Wall of Wind' spell 
is capable of knocking people clean off their feet.  The spell affects
primarily the targetted victim, but it can also hit people who are grouped

group members.  Larger creatures stand a better chance of withstanding
the wall of wind.
~

-1 'WATER BREATHING'~
Syntax: cast 'water breathing'

breathe while submerged in any variety of liquids.  Experiences elementalists
have been said to be able to create other affects with this spell as well.
~


-1 'BODY OF STONE'~
Syntax: cast 'body of stone'

This is a spell of Elemental Earth, used to give the caster the body and
structure of a rockbiter.  Specifically, it increases the caster's 
constitution, and rumours persist that it can also have other affects
if cast by exceptionally gifted Elementalists.
~


-1 'STONEFIST'~
Syntax: cast 'stonefist'

A part of the Earth sphere, the stonefist spell turns the caster's
hands to rock-hard adamantite.  As a result, the elementalist is
very difficult to disarm, and can also pack a meaner punch, so to
speak.
~

-1 'TRAVELER FOG'~
Syntax: cast 'traveler fog'

This spell brings into being a cloud of greenish vapours.  The fog is
a magical creation of the sphere of Air, and by stepping into it, a
person can be transported elsewhere in the world.  Due to the unpredictable
nature of the Air element, the fog's destination is different for anybody who
steps into it.  The fog is unstable, and will collapse once used too many
times.
~

-1 'IRRADIATE'~
Syntax: cast 'irradiate' <victim>

A part of the Energy element, the irradiate spell bombards the victim's
body with unfriendly radiation.  The sickness is terrible and debilitating,
causing exponentially increasing amounts of damage the longer it remains.
The more powerful the caster, the more debilitating this spell is.  It
can be cancelled, dispelled, and 'cure disease' will remove it as well.
~

-1 'RUST ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'rust armor' <victim>

This is an offensive spell that is cast upon your enemy (duh).  The
spell's effect is to attempt to oxidize any armor that the victim is
wearing.  Some materials do not rust easily, and enchanted armor is
especially difficult to affect.  However, rusted armor looses all non-
magical armor class value, making it worth less (but not necessarily
worthless).
~

-1 'RUST WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'rust weapon' <victim>

An offensive earth spell, 'Rust Weapon' attempts to rust whatever 
weapon the victim is wielding.  This spell is powerful, and yet difficult
to land.  Both the victim and his/her weapon receive a saving throw, and
enchanted weapons are very difficult to rust.  Rusted weapons will
gradually loose their damaging potential.
~

-1 'CREATE NODE'~
Syntax: cast 'create node'

This energy spell creates a knot of energy in the fabric of magic.
This node can be placed in almost any room, including ones private home
or clan hall.  Multiple elementalists can use the same room for their
nodes as well.  The elementalist can then move to the knot by using the
'visit node' spell.  Nodes will save across reboots and most crashes,
as well as logins/logouts.

(see also 'visit node')
~

-1 'VISIT NODE'~
Syntax: cast 'visit node'

This spell moves the caster from his/her current location to that of
the last node he/she cast.  This spell can be cast in combat, though
it stands a good chance of failing.

~

-1 'ASPHYXIATE'~
Syntax: cast 'asphyxiate' <target>

A vicious and cruel spell, the asphyxiate spell combusts all of the
air in the victim's lungs, causing excrutiating internal pain.  This

either naturally wears off or is removed.

powerful and versatile tool, and the single trap skill is used for

dodged and avoided by victims.
~

-1 'EARTHBIND'~
Syntax: cast 'earthbind' <target>

The 'earthbind' spell is a versatile and powerful member of the
elementalist's magical assaults.  This spell completely immobilizes

myriad factors that influence its success.

0 NECROMANCER~
The necromancer is the ultimate evil spell caster.  They are completely
incharge of the necromantic spells.  Players who take this kit gain one
new spell (wraithform) and an innate ability (vampiric touch).
Necromancers gain bonuses for being evil when they cast necromantic 
spells. If a necromancer is not living up to their alignment expectations,
they suffer a penality when casting necromantic spells.
Because they live an evil life, their alignment will not drop
when these spells are cast.
Necromancers are also very creepy, so they do not cast beguiling spells
very well.  

see also:  vampiric touch
see also:  wraithform

~
0 WRAITHFORM~

syntax:  c 'wraithform'

By casting this spell, the necromancer is turned into a wraith like mist.
Because they are made of mist, they are limited in thier actions.  
Likewise, there is very little on this world that can affect someone in
wraithform.
The necromancer *MUST* leave wraithform before the duration of the spell
has worn out, or they will die.  All of thier material possessions will
cross into the Netherworld.
Entering into and leaving wraithform does require quite some time to 
accomplish.

see also: UNWRAITH or unwraith, I would really really suggest you read
          the unwraith helpfile. -Boogums


~
0 UNWRAITH~

syntax:  unwraith

This is an automatic command, there is no percent or chance of failure.
This command takes the necromancer out of wraithform.  It must be used
before the spell affect has worn off of the necromancer will be killed
and all of thier belongings will pass into the Netherworld.
~

The enemy command returns all the characters currently in boinga that
are flagged as enemies of your clan.

but can not add anyone manually.
