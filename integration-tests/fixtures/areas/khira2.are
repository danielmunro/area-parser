Customs~
Wide pillars and armed guards ensure that no one enters or leaves
the city unknown or unchecked.  Packs are looked through, pockets
emptied and people taken aside for more thorough searching makes
you nervous, they don't look any different than you.  Nothing 
seems to enter this city that doesn't belong here.

After the bustle of customs, the street is eerily quiet.  Few
people walk the broad street, those that you do see seem to slide
from shadow to shadow, slipping quietly along, bringing little
attention to themselves.  Lanterns set high upon poles light the
street, casting deep shadows against the buildings.

As you move quietly along, you hear a loud creak from above.
Suddenly, without warning, the entire ceiling collapses!!!!
Trapped beneath the rubble and heavy beams that have rotted
through, you realize you're not going to get out of this one
alive.  You take some small comfort in noticing a mangled
body in the wreckage nearby...whoever dumped this on you
managed to kill themselves as well!

Against the stone wall a rickety staircase leads upwards to

imminent.  Scuffles and scrapes echo down the hole above
you, something is moving around up there!

Bits and pieces of plaster and paint chips litter the floor, scraps

A city street~
The shadowy street seems to narrow as you walk along, but when
you look, the buildings are as far apart as ever.  Somehow the 
shadows seem to grow, becoming darker as you move along, even
though the street lights are no fewer than before.

An intersection between two streets is more brightly lit than

A city street~
Faint scratching can be heard from alleys you can't see,
people move quickly from shadow to light to shadow again as

onwards.

A dimly lit intersection is slightly busier than the surrounding

A narrow city street~
The small city street continues on, unchanging, through the
dim light.  Low conversation can be heard from nearby, though
the people holding it cannot be seen, nor can you hear exactly
what they are saying no matter how hard you try.  Peering into
the shadows, you think you can see the outline of people, but
the harder you look, the less it seems real.

A narrow city street~
The street curves gently here and there, the edges of buildings
sometimes well lit, sometimes completely hidden in the shadows. 
The flames in the street lamps burn low, casting murky light that
dies just a small way out from their poles.  The darkness hurts
your eyes, and nothing you do will convince your own light to
cast any more brightness into the darkness.

without sound.  The shadows move inwards, you pull your cloak tighter
around yourself and wonder what they hold.

Stairs to the temple~
You step out of the darkness into an open square surrounded by
flames, torches burn low but steadily, flames a handspan wide but
solid around the square.  The light strangely ends at the edge, all
is darkness beyond, while a great stairway leads up to a looming
image of a dragon, jaws open wide.

A small city street~
This narrow side street seems not quite so threatening as the
others in the city, though you can't detect any real difference.
There is still little lighting, but the shadows seem softer, the
lights warmer.  A child's ball is discarded on the edge of a
shadow just ahead.

Rich wall hangings and roaring fireplaces give the grand lobby 
a warm and inviting appearance.  Comfortable leather furniture 
beckons you to sit and rest, several other gentlemen about the room
are doing the same.  A few well-dressed ladies move about the room,
while an older matron keeps a close eye on things, moving about to
speak with one man or another.

Entrance to the temple~
As you reach the top of the stairs, you find yourself standing
between the very jaws of the dragon, the teeth are as thick as your
leg and covered in some dark brownish substance.  A brief look is
enough for you to realize you don't want to know more.  Ahead, in
the throat of the dragon, is a large doorway of hammered silver.
Faint runes glow blue upon the door.

Inside the temple~
Small flames burn in triangular sconces on the wall, casting an
even glow through the hallways.  Cut from the rock of the mountain,
the stone walls are cold and polished smooth as glass.  The floor
seems to be covered in a thick lair of sand, your footsteps make
no sound as you move along.

A dark alley draws in close, the buildings seem to lean together
above your head, threatening to close in and crush you.  The 
feeling grows the longer you remain, till you can barely draw
a breath.  The narrow darkness clings to your mind, and you

A richly decorated hallway~
A richly decorated hallway is hung with mirrors and fine paintings,
swags of velvet adorn the tops of doorways.  Small brass plates 
identify each doorway leading off the hallway, to the east the plate
reads "Eryn's" while to the west it reads "Lara's".

The fine paintings on the walls draw your eye, they depict scenes
of picnics set in parks, or couples walking along a riverbank.  A
glass chandelier overhead throws patterns of light on the walls, 
which catches on two small brass plaques on the doorways.  To the east
the plaque reads "Cassie's", while to the west it reads "Violette's".

The richly decorated hallway ends here, the mirrors on the wall
reflecting the hallway, making it seem much longer.  Your eye rests
on the doorways and their small plaques.  The one to the east reads
"Natasha's", the one to the west reads "Corinne's", while a door
to the south differs from the rest.  Carved directly into the door
in elegant letters, is "Leia's", you wonder why she differs from
the rest.

Leia's room~
The room is a great contrast to the hallway outside, there is no
mistaking the atmosphere in here.  Black curtains hang from the 
ceiling, surrounding a large bed, also entirely black.  The walls
are rough stone, the floor the same, with rings set here and there.
A large stone fireplace roars in the corner, but its heat seems to
end a short distance from it.

covering.  A table in one corner has a lace cloth protecting
its surface from a large vase, full of red roses.

This part of the street is brighter, much better lit than anywhere
else you've encountered so far.  People move here and there, chatting
with neighbors while their kids play with one another.  Off to the
east is what looks like a marketplace, while the fountain here seems
to mark this place as a social gathering spot as well.

Massive wall hangings adorn the room, rich in colour and design.
Complicated patterns mesmerize the eye, making it difficult to focus
on anything.  Across one entire wall is a huge mosaic built of jet,
ebony and obsidian, depicting a dragon in flight.  An altar sits just
below the head of the dragon.

At the altar of the Silver Dragon~
Massive wall hangings adorn the room, rich in colour and design.
Complicated patterns mesmerize the eye, making it difficult to focus
on anything.  Across one entire wall is a huge mosaic built of chips
and slivers of quartz and silver, depicting a dragon in flight.  An
altar sits just below the head of the dragon.

The Shadow Gates~
As you enter the room, the torches on the wall seem to flicker and
go dim.  Poorly lit, you can just make out the swirling forms of some
kind of magical gates throughout the room.  A faint glow at the top
of each is the only way to tell them apart, and there is nothing that
indicates their destination.

A rough tunnel~
You find yourself in a rough tunnel, running almost straight up 
and down.  Metal rungs are bolted into the rock every so often,
making it less difficult to climb.  You look up, but there's no
way of telling where it leads, while below a trapdoor sags
beneath your feet.

A rough tunnel~
A ledge juts out from the rock, forming one end of the tunnel.
It is very difficult to see, and the space is quite tight, but
you're sure you see a small trapdoor above your head.  With some
effort you should be able to reach it.  Below, it is impossible
to tell how far you'd fall if you slipped, or what you would
land on.

A small library~
A one room library is an odd thing, you think, but given the lack
of people you've seen out on the streets, maybe not all that odd.
Books cover the shelves from floor to ceiling, and a small sign out
board is near the doorway.  It looks like in the City of Thieves they
rely on honesty to return the books on time.

book books shelves~
The books cover a broad range of subjects, but the predominant one
would seem to be the art of thievery.  Books on slight of hand, grace,
speed, and the art of moving silently are common, although there are
many books on art, literature and history as well.

A tidy little house~
Not to tidy, not to untidy, this place is pretty comfortable.  The
kind of place you know its ok to sit back and put your feet up on
the table, but if you make a pot of dinner you'd better wash up
afterwards.  All in all, a nice spot to be.

A scruffy bachelor's pad~
What a mess.  What a complete and utter pigsty.  Clothing is
everywhere, dumped here and there with no way of knowing what's
clean or dirty, piles of unwashed dishes sit on the small table,
and a pot by the fire contains some unidentifiable substance that
might pass as food.  The urge to throw up is only surpassed by
the urge to leave.

An artist's studio~
This house looks less like someone's home and more like someone's
studio.  Canvasses are stacked up against the walls, several easels
hold works in progress.  Paint splashes are all over the floor, the
walls have many coloured splatters on them, the sink in the corner
is the oddest mixture of colours.  A fold-out cot is tucked in 
behind the door, neatly out of the way.

A small cottage~
This little house is so much like a country cottage, it's hard to
believe you're in the middle of an underground city.  Fresh flowers
adorn the table, and neatly stitched samplers hang on the walls.
A small cat sits beside the fireplace, enjoying the heat.

A small, cosy home~
Warm and cozy, this small one room house is obviously someone's
home.  A fire burns merrily in one corner, a table is set with
simple fare.  A rope-slung bed with a straw mattress is in the
opposite corner, well away from the fire, it looks very comfortable.

A small one room house~
This small, one room house is neat and clean, everything is stored
in its own proper place.  Shelves line the walls, each clearly
labeled to prevent confusion.  In such a small home the owner would
have to be tidy and well organized.

shelf shelves~
One shelf is labeled "food", another "spices", yet another is
labeled "medicinals".  You peer into the shelves, and sure enough
each item's name is also neatly lettered in the spot it should sit.
The supplies are so meagre, you don't even think about taking any.

A narrow alley leads into deeper shadows, it is impossible to see

The alley stops at a dead end, the only way out is back the way

from your own, and here deep underground it seems a very feeble
light at that.

In the lair of the Black Dragon~
A large room has been cut out of the rock, it is very plain for
the lair of a dragon.  You get the feeling the priests of the temple
built it to entice the dragon to stay, but that the beast only visits
on a whim.  Far above, you can see a hole letting in some feeble rays 
of sunlight.
