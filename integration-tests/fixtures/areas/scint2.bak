Legend has it that long ago the city of Lorentheal thrived and prospered
with the blessings of Megena, the creator of the elven race. Eons passed
and the elves of the city lost their way, tricked by the gods of evil and
mischief. It is said, that in a fit of jealous rage, Megena cursed the city
and all its inhabitants. Without Megena's protection, the gods of evil 
loosed a legion of darkness upon the cursed city, destroying all within it.

Scaling the Cliff~
The cliff below disappears into the dark mist which forms the storm 
clouds. All around you, the sound of thunder echoes off the cliff face 
with a continual roar. Electricity pulses through the air and causes 
your hair to stand on end. A flash of golden lightning strikes the cliff, 
illuminating the dark mist briefly, then fades away to blackness. The 
summit lies directly above you.

The Summit of the Mountain~
You have reached the summit of the mountain. The storm vents its rage all
around you. Thunderheads rush past you like a dark wall of mist. The blanket
of snow covering the ground, glitters with blue and golden flecks, when the
lightning briefly illuminates the world around you. The scent of ozone and
freshly fallen snow lingers on the fierce wind. The darkened clouds shroud
the path across the summit.

Your light falls in a small circle around you and casts flickering shadows
across the damp ground. Tendrils of fog seep through the cracks which form
the trap door above you. Your light glows off them and creates eerie shapes
which seem to reach out towards you in the darkness. You can barely see a
tunnel which leads to the north.

altar still stands at the back of the temple. Water seeps from the cracks
within its charred surface. Dusty skeletons litter the floor, some still
clutching their holy symbols. The stench of ancient death penetrates the
air around you.

The Ruined Court Yard~
Wild roses grow along the ancient stones that form the wall encircling
the court yard. Broken, marble benches still circle what is left of the
fountain. Its stagnant water trickles down the cracked stone basin and
pools across the ground in deep green puddles. Cobwebs flutter on the
cold, night wind that blows eternally through the doorways to the east
or west.

The Ancient Temple~
Enormous slabs of green marble lie in random heaps across the floor. 
Ancient scrolls lie molding within a shattered, glass cabnet, at the back
of the room. The cold, night wind howls through the gaping holes that stare
out from the walls like soulless eyes. Dusty skeletons litter the charred
floor, some still clutching their holy symbols. The stench of ancient death
penetrates the air around you.

A Ruined Shop~
Debris and dust covers the blood stained floor. Cobwebs hang across
broken bits of furniture that lie in heaps around the ruined shop. A
cold, dark wind gusts through what is left of the opened window. It 
whisper malevolently to you as it flutters the tattered curtains.

The Ruined Library~
Black streaks mar the stone floor. The remains of shelves and ancient
scrolls scatter across the cracked floor. The skeletons on ancient wizards
and scribes still lie where they where slain. Their white bones rotting and
scorched. Cobwebs hang across the shattered desk that lies at the back of
the room. The stench of death and decay hang in the air around you.

Moss creeps across the rows of broken benches that scatter across the

of stone lies upon its rotting wood. The mist flows in through the gaping
holes in the what is left of the walls. The stench of death hangs in the

The Collapsing Bell Tower~
The staircase crumbles beneath you. Parts of the floor boards rot away and
leave gaping holes across it. An enormous bell take up most of the tower.
A strong gust of wind causes it to ring. The sound echoes forlornly through
the ruined city.

On A Narrow Ledge~
The weeds and underbrush block the path ahead. A small cave forms a dark 
hole in the side of the mountain to the north. Faint sounds echo from 
within it, but they are hard to distinguish over the roar of the wind and 
the rumble of thunder.

Lost in the Darkness~
The inky blackness seem to stretch forever onwards. Your light barely
penetrates its ebony surface. A vague shape seems to shift within the dark
cave. A cold gust of wind causes you to shiver. The faint sound of water 
dripping echoes off the damp, stone walls.

The Ruined Potion Shop~
The remains of broken bottles scatter across the blood stained floor. A
rotting wooden shelf still hangs by one hinge, its contents spilled and faded
across the pile of debris beneath it. Cobwebs flutter on the dark wind that
blows eternally through the gaping holes within what is left of the wall. A
skeleton lies, decapitated, amid the broken glass. Its hand still clutches
an amulet from long ago.

Within the Etherealness~
Faint, unearthly light glows from all points around you. The thin air
makes it hard to breathe. Vague shapes form then disappear around you in
an endless parade of colors. Far below you, thunderheads race across the
world like dark wraiths. Circular bursts of brilliant red briefly alight
the world then fade away. The stars flicker faintly against the surreal
sky above you. The etherealness spans out in all directions.

A Small Pond~
Tall grass waves on the gusts of wind that blow fallen leaves across the
tiny beach. Waves break against its edge and form lacy patterns in the soft
sand. Water fowl float across the pond and call out to each other. The clear
blue water reflects the sky overhead in rippled patterns. Lightning flashes
against the darkened thunderheads and causes the water to glow momentarily in
deep blue and golden hues. The pond stretches out to the north or east.

A Small Pond~
Tendrils of mist creep out of the trees at the waters edge and float like
wraiths across the pond. Their leaves whisper softly when the cold wind 
gusts through them. Lightning flashes overhead and alights the pond in hues 
of deep blue and gold. The surface of the water continues to the north or

A Small Pond~
Ducks hide within the tall reeds that grow along the ponds edge. The cool 
water flows softly across your skin as you swim within it. A loud clap of
thunder rumbles overhead while the storm grows in intensity. Ligntning   
flashes, briefly alighting the water in deep blue and golden hues. To the 
north, a small stream flows into the pond and ripples its surface in lacy 
patterns.

Tall reeds grow along the waters edge. The wind seems to whisper softly

A Gurgling Stream~
Tendrils of mist creep out of the forest's edge then waft around the reeds
that grow beside the small stream. The fine mist flows out over the brook 
with swirling motions. Tiny schools of fish swim beneath the clear water. 
They create colorful patterns as they dart in and out of the small rock 
formations at the stream's bottom. The currents pull your boat to the south.
The stream continues to the north.

a great distance echoes faintly from within the hole. The brook's currents

Within the Sea Cliff~
Warmth radiates from a large fireplace set within the cave wall. Its
flames cast intricate patterns of orange-yellow light that flicker off
the walls and ceiling. Fine white sand glitters like tiny stars as it
blankets the floor. Its cool, soft grains are soothing to the touch. 
Humid gusts of warm wind brush sensuously across your skin and carry  
on them, the tangy scent of the sea. A natural spring flows from within
the stone floor, gurgling softly. Deep, blue waves crash upon the beach 
outside and echo rhythemically through the cave, soothing you.
