============
  Astral travel can be the quickest way to move around 
our land.  However one must have a clue as to the creatures
that live in the destination area.  The following list
has been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the
traveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the
new Astral traveler.
 
  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!
  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.
  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature
     elsewhere to trap you.
  4) The target creature may be cursed.  Your spell will fail.
  5) The target creature may be charmed.  Your spell will fail.
 
  Much of this information is also useful for the portal and
nexus spells.  These spells are often under-utilized.  You 
may wish to reflect on their use in your practice of magick.

These tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  
Use these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every 
mage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling 
experience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, 
learn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.

war9~
Hunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few 
factors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment 
are they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If 
they are not leveling, use gate points to search around places 
where they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  
If you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall 
or return to their halls.
~
E
war8~
Maladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not 
be able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points 
and hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For 
elementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells 
such as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent 
much weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions 
group will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain 
away an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will 
lower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their 
vision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his 
eyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to 
drain their mana and movement points.
~
E
war7~
Healing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good 
idea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  
However, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of 
combat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the 
'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it 
heals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  
If you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point 
regeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable 
you to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  
If you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  
It might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available 
for sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other 
potions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant 
you some health regeneration in combat.
~
E
war6~
For Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every 
caster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  
If you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if 
you go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand 
death on.  This spell will enable you to "cheat" death.  Once 
you have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage 
of your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.
~
E
war5~
Use Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster 
class has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For 
example, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, 
and wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to 
completely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This 
can give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other 
methods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned 
before using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain 
spell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent 
will be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or 
her, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not 
try to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will 
not fail it.
~
E
war4~
Use Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has 
its own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal 
themselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists 
have a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use 
your class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, 
as both of these will hurt and help you in combat.
~
E
war3~
Know When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  
Know yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know 
when to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you 
are very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways 
to escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric 
class, the "mirror image" spell in the psionics group will 
enable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, 
while your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks 
is you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make 
your life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose 
wisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you 
do pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other 
casters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation 
group to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help 
you with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells 
IN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can 
use either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat 
as its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  
You can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  
Certain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a 
jar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your 
last option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes 
and have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't 
cursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better 
option than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  
If you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and 
your opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray 
recall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive 
instantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or 
to a place of safety.
~
E
war2~
Use Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you 
are a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth 
like a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  
Destroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your 
magic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, 
being a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.
~
E
war1~
Know Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who 
you are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability 
which you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use 
weapons with the "flame" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, 
the "incinerate" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  
Realize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a 
sleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  
The mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a 
much easier time coming out of that battle alive.

*** The Art Of War ***
    (1st Edition)
{x
In ages long ago, this world was born of magic. Some
of our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. 
Unfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic 
are also threatened by both renegades, and by those 
who would seek to destroy those who are more powerful 
than themselves.  To defend themselves against these 
renegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.
{x
Anazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key
points in this art.

The white robes of warlock with their more peaceful and inquiring
natures stand at one end of the warlock spectrum.  Blackrobes with
their heightened combat skills and ability to deliver punishment
and retribution stand at the other end of the warlock spectrum.
Warlock gains strength when we are active across the full spectrum
of activities.  It falls to the red robes to help make it so as
we are the ones in the middle bridging the gap between white and
black.  Our primary goals as red robes are spelled out in the 
charter:
 
  1) Recruiting 
  2) Fund raising
 
We have secondary goals as well:
 
  1) Assist black robes with punishment and retributions when
     needed and feasible. (optional)
  2) Assist white robes with research, equipping, and advising
     young casters. (optional)
  3) Keep up to date on clan activities and be a source of information
     for other clan members. (required)

*** Red Robe Sect, Guidelines ***
          1st Edition
 
From our charter we have a clear, if rather general, description of
the role of a red robe in Warlock.  It reads:
 
"Those who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help 
with clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to
recruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances."
 
The aim of this tome is too clarify and organize our sect so 
that we can better do the job set out in our charter.

Not all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage 
directly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.
 
Flameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire 
vuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. 
The spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the 
Elemental Plane of Fire.
 
Used in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in 
several charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also
are handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,
or to initiate combat.

Rivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and
sonic blast.
 
Sunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is 
slightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind 
your victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.
 
Sonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is 
slightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your 
victim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in 
Altirin.
~
E
wiz6~
Not all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond 
skin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as 
adamanatite skin.
 
Steel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a 
moderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours 
(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel 
clam, in Buccaneer Bay.
 
Diamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a 
lengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting 
level / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two 
rooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.
 
Both these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using 
the "copyspell" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.
~
E
wiz5~
Incinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy
yinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.
 
To create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires 
and a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the 
scroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon
in the depths of hell.
 
Place all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild 
in Midgaard and type "forge magelab".  The fire sapphires will burst into 
flames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and 
shatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,
if aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the 
scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.
 
This scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, 
held, and copied using the "copyspell" command.
~
E
wiz4~
Adamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend 
themselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes
with a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 
hours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the 
duration by 2 hours.
 
To create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective 
sapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for 
details on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north
of the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.
 
Place all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild 
in Midgaard and type "forge magelab".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires 
will begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the 
scroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding 
forces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will 
be bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of 
adamantite skin.
 
This scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, 
held, and copied using the "copyspell" command.

In order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this 
skill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of 
these two spells, failure is costly.
Research can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get 
it this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if 
someone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the 
following into account:
 
Intelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.
Intelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.
Intelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.
Intelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.
Intelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.
Intelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.
This only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only 
increases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of 
two by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.

The cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need 
six eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs 
though, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a 
crucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although 
this item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't 
hurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.
 
Sapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required 
number of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type "forge crucible".  The 
eggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin 
requires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate 
uses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.
 
For more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the 
Novice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.

The Scroll of Binding is a key ingredient in both of a wizard's researchable 
spells, adamantite skin and incinerate.  However, this item does not exist in 
this world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.
 
Firstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the 
binding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of
Sorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to 
start with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank 
scrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding 
properties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the 
numerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track 
down one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen 
Spider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be 
formed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held 
within the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  
Instead, two diamonds need to be used.
 
Place the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into 
the binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type "forge 
kit" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust 
and the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,
retrievable from the binding kit.

The Plane of Pure Magic~
As you float in the mists of the Clan Hall of Warlock, you wonder as to
how this could be. You are not entrapped in the cold stone walls that you
would expect to see. Somehow you have been transported to a place of pure
magical energy. All around you are swirling orbs of red, white, and black,
that seem to pulsate and writhe as though they are alive. As you stand 
amongst these orbs you can feel your body heal and your magic seems to be
growing with every second. To the east you see a portal with a dagger
encircled by a brilliant glow.

You have left the sanctity of the glowing orbs, and have found yourself in

look down and your stomach churns, for there seems to be no end to this
pit. You feel a gust of wind pulling you down to the depths below. You
have been falling for what seems like days, before finally you come to a
halt. Weapons and armor are scattered all over the place. As you look for
an exit and there appears to be none, you grab all the equipment you may
need, for you may be here a while.

Notice to Customers:
The rumor that Warlock clan vouchers only cost 35 eggs
is incorrect.  Warlock doesn't get any more of a special price
than any other clan.  If this was due to a quest, it was a long
time ago, and the current administration does not recognize it.
Sorry for any confusion.

The mage lab of the Warlock clan is truly a sight to behold, the room is
immense, and crackles with the raw magical energies that are focused here.
Ancient tomes, containers, pipes, instruments from the bizarre to the mundane
fill the shelves from floor to ceiling awaiting their next user.  Large granite
tables, heat baths, and a few furnaces fill most of the floor space, only
leaving the most modest of personal space for the spellcaster.  You are certain
that even the most inept spellcaster could produce spectacular results with the
equipment and knowledge contained here.

You can't help but feel that you will learn the arts faster in this place.
