-1 CLAN CLANS~
Throught Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common
cause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the
spread of light, or the falling of the apocalypse.  These clans are:

BALANCE, Keepers of Neutrality   ("Help Balance")
The never-ending CIRCLE of magic ("Help Circle")
DEMISE, Bringers of Darkness     ("Help Demise")
HONOR, Defenders of Light        ("Help Honor")
The LEGION of Goblins            ("Help Legion")
POSSE, Riders of Vengeance       ("Help Posse")
The RIDERS of the Apocalypse     ("Help Riders")

In order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,
either by tells or via a note.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as
follows:

-- You must be between the levels of 5 and 25 or a Loner or an Outcast
of any level.  After you have exceeded level 25, and have not either 
joined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.

Once you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If
for some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you
must first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  Also, be wary, for those
who make frequent changes in their clan find themselves clanless quickly.
