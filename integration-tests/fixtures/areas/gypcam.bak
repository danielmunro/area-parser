Trail in the deep forest.~
You are on a small trail in the deep forest. The trees cover most of the sky
with their leaves making for an impenetrable wall above your head. Wagon
tracks dug deep into the mud make for an easy track to follow to the north.
From their looks, they seem to be fresh.

Beginning of the Gypsy Camp~
You are at the beginning of the gypsy camp. The wagons can be seen in a
circular formation. A fire built in the center of the circle seems to be 
the only source of light illuminating the whole campsite. Music can be heard
coming from near the fire, while snoring sounds come from inside the cabin
to the west. Horses can be seen all tied to a rope which extends between
two trees near a small stream.

Inside the Wagon~
You are inside the wagon. Pots and pans hang from a thin sturdy rope. A
small potbellied stove rests beside the large bed which fills the opposite
end of the wagon, taking up most of the room. A retractable table is propped
on a piece of wood, while two chairs line the wall. Two small windows - one
over the bed - and the other covered by the table are the only sources of
natural light. A lantern hook protrudes from the ceiling. This wagon was
obviously built for long travel and comfort.

Inside the Wagon~
You are inside the wagon. Pots and pans hang from a thin sturdy rope. A
small potbellied stove rests beside the large bed which fills the opposite
end of the wagon, taking up most of the room. A retractable table is propped
on a piece of wood, while two chairs line the wall. Two small windows - one
over the bed - and the other covered by the table are the only sources of
natural light. A lantern hook protrudes from the ceiling. This wagon was
obviously built for long travel and comfort.

unrecognizable symbols. Each symbol is painted with true artistic impression.

You have climbed onto the buckboard. Here the driver sits to drive this large
wagon on the many roads that the gypsies follow every year. The seat looks
quite comfortable, padded and covered with strong leather. From this view
you can see the campfire burning brightly. A small window used to pass
food to the driver during travel is closed and covered with pink curtains.

on a piece of wood, while two chairs line the wall. Two small windows - one
over the bed - and the other covered by the table are the only sources of
natural light. A lantern hook protrudes from the ceiling. This wagon was
obviously built for long travel and comfort.

Harness of the wagon~
You are in front of a wagon. The harness gear has been left here to dry out
for the night. The tug sits on an old rotted log. Looking up you see the
buckboard, where the driver sits. The front of the wagon is covered with
unrecognizable symbols. Each symbol is painted with true artistic impression.

Steps of a wagon~
You are on the steps of one of many wagons. The wagon seems to be built
entirely of wood and is quite sturdy. The steps lead up onto a small ledge
which holds two barrels of water. A door can be seen leading inside the
wagon.

On the Buckboard~
You have climbed onto the buckboard. Here the driver sits to drive this large
wagon on the many roads that the gypsies follow every year. The seat looks
quite comfortable, padded and covered with strong leather. From this view
you can see the campfire burning brightly. A small window used to pass
food to the driver during travel is closed and covered with pink curtains.

Ledge on the wagon~
You are on the ledge of the wagon. The ledge is roughly five feet long
and allows room for a chair to be placed on it while travelling. A barrel
filled with rain water sits on each side of the door. The door is well
crafted of fine wood and has a brass doorknob. Markings of unknown origin
cover the door to make an intricate design of mystery and intrigue.

markings~
The markings on the door are symbols unrecognizable to you. They are in a
pattern; but what this pattern could mean you cannot fathom. The door is
built of solid oak and seems to be firmly attached to the wagon with three
strong hinges.

Inside the Wagon~
You are inside the wagon. Pots and pans hang from a thin sturdy rope. A
small potbellied stove rests beside the large bed which fills the opposite
end of the wagon, taking up most of the room. A retractable table is propped
on a piece of wood, while two chairs line the wall. Two small windows - one
over the bed - and the other covered by the table are the only sources of
natural light. A lantern hook protrudes from the ceiling. This wagon was
obviously built for long travel and comfort.

In the stream~
You are knee deep in the stream a small waterfall is to the west where
the current is to strong to be passed by foot. The stream continues east
near where the horses are tied. The water is crystal clear and seems cool
and calm here. You make a mental note to take someone you care for skinny
dipping here should it ever happen.

A small clearing~
You are in a small clearing where the horses have been tied for the night
a small tent is errected here for the man guarding the horse. It is lit
with a small lantern and has a small fire in front of it. The horses are
tied to a strong rope near the stream which is to the north. They can 
easily reach the water shore but the rope prevents them from going any
further.

In the stream~
You are knee deep in the stream. Here you can see the horses tied to a 
strong rope which stops them from running out into the wilderness. The 
water is clear and blue and is fresh to the taste. You can see the small
tent off into the small clearing to the south. Most probably made for
the man guarding the horses.

You are in the small pup tent. There is little room to look around.
A bunch of blankets have been left here for the man who guards the horses
to sleep in. A small pillow lies on the ground beside the blankets. The
man seems to have stepped out for a the time being since no one is here.

You have entered the First church of Matook. The hallway leads to the Altar
room where brightly lit candles can be seen burning brightly. To the east
the entrance to the first aid station can be seen. No extra gold adorn the
walls. Practical is the key word of this church. It is painted in bright
colors and seems to be very welcoming to anyone who enters.
