A small, narrow tunnel~
You stoop to fit inside this small, narrow part of the tunnel.  
Darkness surrounds you, and it is impossible to tell how far back
the tunnel stretches.  Faint echos bounce back at you, but it is
impossible to tell how far away they are coming from.

Where tunnels meet~
The tunnel widens into a small alcove, tunnels stretching off in
all directions.  You can barely make out the shadowy entrances, which
look exactly the same as each other.  In fact, you start to wonder where
you entered, let alone where you should travel next.

A bend in the tunnel~
As you hold your torch up, peering into the darkness, you could
swear you've been here before.  With no distinguishing features to
the rock or the tunnel, its hard to know where you've been and where
you haven't.

An intersection in the tunnel~
A small intersection gives you a little more room than usual, though
not much.  The only light that shines is your own, and still the odd
echos reflect forwards and back, with no way of knowing if you are the
cause or something else is making them.

A straight path is a welcome change, even if the appearance of it

A blank wall is all that greets you here, the featureless rock the

turn, though where you have no idea.  The way back through the dark,
unchanging tunnels behind seems a daunting undertaking, but there is
no other choice.

Another branching in the tunnels.  Will this never end?  No matter

The darkness moves in closer than ever, echos adding to the sense

You carefully clamber up the rock, hanging tightly onto the ledges

wandering around down below in the darkness.  A strange, shimmering
light flickers above, but you can't tell what is causing it.

This is definitely not an ordinary spot in the mess of tunnels that
stretch out beneath you.  The handholds in the rock face end here, and
just above your head a strange, shimmering wall ripples and moves like
liquid metal.  You can take your chances climbing into the strange wall,
or crawl back into the darkness below.
