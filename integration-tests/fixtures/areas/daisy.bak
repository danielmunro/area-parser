Entrance to a Gypsy Camp~
You stand at the entrance to a gypsy camp.  Children's laughter and the
mournful sounds of a violin reach your ears.  The numerous wagons and 
tents in the area speak of a people without a homeland.  The camp is

tent.

A Wagon in Need of Repair~
It will be impossible for the gypsies to travel any farther until this 
wagon's wheel is replaced.  No one, however, appears too concerned about
it. To your east is a much newer wagon.  South of here is the main path
through the camp.

violin melody wraps itself around your soul.  You smile a little sadly

Shaking off the melancholy, you remember that you stand on an east-west
path through a gypsy camp.  There are wagons to the north and south, and
a campfire to your east.

Siamese Twins Ming and Diem, to the south is the tent of the tattooed
man.  The midway continues to your west.
