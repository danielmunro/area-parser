Road to Newfane~
You are on a gently curving north-south road.  On your east side a youthful
river sparkles blue and rushes in the sunlight.  On the west, green leaves and
green ferns burst against the rich brown earth.  You feel the heat of your
healthy muscles as you travel swiftly down the well-paved road.

harpsichord player provide the music.  You hear scattered screams of joy
from the dancers.

You are inside an old church full of life.  Piews lign up left and right
of the altar where a wooden chalice rests.  Many wooden ornaments
fill the church, hand carved by a dedicated parishioner.  You feel the spirit
of many generations infuse you.  The essence of tradition, love and respect
fills the air around you.  You have feeling that something magic is going
to happen here between two special people.
