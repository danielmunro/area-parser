Dark Passageway~
Your torches flicker and flare as you head down through a dark passage,
passing below the bustling streets of Midgaard.  An oppressive mood hangs
in the air, prickling at your spine.  You realize that if you were an
enemy of Demise you would be dead by now...

The Hall of Clan Demise~
The darkness and smoke in the room envelops your mood.  A bit of your
evil side starts to come out.  The room is quite messy as when your
concern is death and destruction housekeeping is of little importance.
This seems like a good place to hide from other Clans.

The Altar~
This room is shrouded in perpetual darkness, with sconces on the wall 
flickering with an eerie violet flame.  A large emblem on the north wall
proclaims the glories of Cthon, patron deity of Demise. His blood-soaked
altar lies directly under it, with blackened instruments of death awaiting
new victims.  A statue sits on either side of the altar, the right one of
Eiji, founder of the clan, the left of Valnor, its second leader. The room
reeks of evil darkness, making you feel quite at home.
 
A large Golden Altar stands in the middle of the room.

The statues are carved from solid marble, and enlaid with gold. They must have
cost a fortune.  Each is portrayed with sword upraised and shield on guard,
ready to slay enemies for the great Cthon.

A Grim Hallway~
This hallway is lined with torches, but they burn only fitfully, leaving you
shrouded in darkness and smoke. Shields and swords marked with the scars
of battle line either wall.  South is the main hall of Clan Demise, and
to the north lies the altar of dark Cthon.

'Shadow Walk'~
Shadows dance in the pale green light as you step into the chamber.
Thick wart like growths cover the chamber walls. It is rumored that these
'warts' are parts of people's souls, forever living a tortured existance,
only to be released when the last spark of life has been crushed by
the faithful Demise worshipers.  In the center of this chamber sits a
mass of darkness.  Its shadows moving, reaching towards you, almost as
if to wrap itself around your body to embrace you in its evil presence.
  Before the dark mass sits an old wooden sign.

that binds us.

DEATH surrounds you.  Corpses everywhere hanging on meat hooks, for 
future use as tanks or for decoration.  It is cold in here and there
is a really funky smell in the air so get in and out as fast as you
can.
A wooden door is in the middle of the freezer room.

Demise Advanced Magelab~
Upon entering a small, bleak room, you are struck by the change in the
surroundings.  The stagnant, slightly warm air pulsates with a profound
throb, and the base of your spine quakes in deference to some awesome
power that eludes your conscious sense, which can only detect a dearth
of something unplacable that distinguishes this cell from the rest of the
hall.  A pipe projects from one wall and connects to a distorted metal
structure that resembles, to your impetuous imagination, a battered rib
cage.  On it is a small label.  Two stone statues glare down at the room.
Following their gaze to the winding stairway which led you here, your
nostrils fill with the familiar stench of blood, placating your unease.
