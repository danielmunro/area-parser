Outside the House~
   You are outside a large house, which looks rather fancy, and 
quite expensive.  The sky above you seems to turn black, but only above
the house.  This seems to be the darker, lower part of the Dwarven Valley.
The trees around the house seem to have died out, as if some aura from
the house is killing off the life.

The valley continues off to the south, and a tall, black door is to the 
north at the front of the house.
