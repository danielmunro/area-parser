Gronk the Cook~
Gronk the ship's cook is here, preparing some distasteful repast.
~
Gronk looks like he belongs below the deck, because he smells almost as
bad as the food he's making.  He seems to be about half-minotaur, 
half-orc, and half-something else which you can't put a finger on.
He doesn't appreciate the way you're analyzing his heritage, and
snarls loudly.  SNARRRL.

Prow of the "Banshee"~
You inhale the hearty seabreeze at the ship's prow, as the mighty
"Banshee" cuts through the seafoam at great speeds.  A huge bronze and
steel ram carved in the form of a giant fist jutts out the front,
bringing certain death to slow or unprotected merchant ships.  Pirate
sailors are trimming the sails or sharpening their weapons, and most
are too occupied to take notice of you.
  To the south you can see a large mast.

Foremast~
A wooden mast extends high into the sky here, covered with rigging and
sail.  The shouts and cries of naval jargon overwhelm you as the sleek
craft ploughs effortlessly through the Dragon Sea.  The wooden hull holds
up sturdily under the massive weight of the gigantic masts, and you
have no fear of a sudden breach in the ship.
  The mainmast lies directly south of here, and the rigging of the mast
leads upwards.

Mainmast~
This area of the deck is bustling with activity.  Sailors are clambering
nimbly up the rigging of the mainmast like monkeys, and precious cargo
is being lowered into the hold by a great platfrom connected with a 
pulley.
  A ladder leads down into the shadowy depths of the hold, and the main
cabin lies to the south.  You can climb the rigging up the mast, where
the crow's nest station is.

Captain Kalish'ah's Quarters~
This is the most richly decorated room you have ever laid eyes upon, and
fittingly, it belongs to the cruel and calculating Captain Kalish'ah, 
the leader of the bloodthirsty crew of the "Banshee".  Silver chalices
filled with diamonds sit on platinum inlayed tables, and priceless
works of art hang in frames of the purest gold.  Truly Kalish'ah enjoys
the riches he cunningly steals from those weaker than he.

Entrance Hall of the Main Cabin~
Unlike the deck, the entry hall of the cabin is full of elegant splendor,
the spoils of unwary merchantmen on the high seas.  Torches are held in
golden sconces, and exotic carpets from Sri Raji cover the floor.  Fine
ornamental weapons are mounted on the wall, and maps of all the islands
of the seas are presented in beautiful crystal cases along the wall.
  There is an oaken door to the east marked with a wizard's rune, and
another door to the west.  A finely carved elvenwood double door bars
the way to the south.
  A ladder leads upwards through a trapdoor to the bridge.

Najir's Quarters~
The ship's wizard Najir makes his home in this well-appointed room of 
the main cabin.  Shelves of spellbooks line the walls and scrolls of
every make and description are neatly ordered in a rack by the far wall.
Beakers full of chemicals bubble away on a stone counter, and you have
no doubt that the fiendish wizard is obviously concocting some vile 
poison for his own evil purposes.

The powerful chaplain of the pirates, Shak'Ra, maintains his quarters 
here.  A blood-streaked obsidian altar dominates the room, apparently
used for ritual sacrifices.  The altar is covered with silver-inlaid
runes, and dedicated to Valnor, the Dark God.  Instruments of torture 
drip blood from the racks which hold them, and you shiver as you can 
almost hear the terrifying screams of Shak'Ra's victims.

supports creaking with every pitch and roll of the deck.  Determined
deck-hands pull on yardarms to hold the mighty power of the wind in 
check.  The deck is strewn with iron bars, poles, rope and other 
equipment.
  A large ballista can be seen at the stern of the ship, to the south.
The rigging also provides a way up to a lookout.

Stern of the "Banshee"~
The stern of the ship is fitted with a large ballista used to fire
heavy fiery bolts at enemy ships.  Several pirates carefully oil the
many parts of the large crossbow, to insure that its deadly aim remains
accurate.  Large ballista bolts are neatly grouped in bundles by 
the weapon, easily accessible in times of need.  Beyond the stern
lies only the churning sea.
  You can see the mizzenmast to the north.

The starboard deck is quite clean, due mostly to the constant swabbing

not to bother these drunken men, but you doubt that even a roaring

would make a dockworker blush.

out rare wealth from all corners of Boinga.  You nearly weep at the sight
of the elvish jewels from the valley, and the platinum wrought jewelry
from Ofcol.  All taken from butchered merchants who were unlucky enough
to cross the "Banshee"'s path.
  The door to a steel cage bars the way to the east.

Pirate Treasure Room~
Your jaw drops in awe as you enter this room.  Here, the pirates
store all the most valuable jewels and treasures they pillage.
Gold and silver chalices shimmer, as massive piles of jewels, rings,
and gems reflect the candlelight.  Unfortunately, there is far too much
loot to carry...perhaps a few choice tidbits wouldn't be missed.
  A plank in the floor seems a little out of place.

The sleeping quarters of the pirates smell like the burning corpses of
a hundred trolls.  Bottles of rum and dirty shirts litter the floor,
and the only furniture seems to be crude hammocks fashioned from
bedsheets or sails, which hang from wall to wall.  What these 
bloodthirsty pirates lack in hygiene they apparently make up for in
cruelty and you are careful not to disturb any of the buccaneers who
are snoring in their bunks.

Bridge~
The ship's bridge is the brain of the "Banshee".  The massive wooden
shipwheel bolted into the boards attracts your attention almost 
immediately.  The seabreeze cools your face, and you feel like a 
gallant seaman conquering the seas.  Then you remember the number
of evil pirates about you and you assume a more cautious demeanor.  
  A ladder leads downwards through a trapdoor, the only exit to this
small but vital part of the ship, and a door blocks the way to the
south.

The smell of roasted haggis revolts you and the room is a mess.  Only 
in one corner of the room, is there some semblance of cleanliness.
There, a flower bed full of dead flowers attempts to brighten up the room.
Apparently, Willie didn't know that flowers don't usually grow well in
the hold of a sailing ship.

The torches lining the wall offer the sole source of light in the room,

Fields for the Dead~
You are surrounded by fields of scorched grass.  Short tree stumps litter
the ground, black and crumbling.  There is nothing left living for as far
as you can see.  Sun-bleached bones of those who could not outrun the 
deadly fires are scattered all around you.  You see sone that are clearly
animal bones, but among them you see human skulls and other remains.  You
are almost overcome by the everpresent stench of death and decay hanging 
in the air.

The Foyer of Gwenhwyvar's Tower~
You are now in a medium-sized room, lavishly decorated with intricately
weaved, richly coloured tapestries.  The tower is filled with a sense of
foreboding evil and you are unable to control a shiver as you survey the
room.  Two windows allow splinters of light into the otherwise dark room.
Through one window you can make out the ivory-white marble walls of
Blackstaff's Tower.  The other gives you a view of a vast plain of clouds,
completely devoid of anything but a thick, white mist.  Directly before
you, ebony stairs lead up to the higher levels of the tower.

Gwenhwyvar's Living Quarters~
The room is sparcely furnished, with only the bare necessities gracing
the view of the room before you.  No dust has settled over the furniture or
the floor, as though it is scared to do so.  A small bed with beautiful
black silk sheets is in the corner.  Opposite the bed is a fireplace, its
hearth carved of pure obsidian and its ever=present warmth takes a bit of
the unnatural chill from the room.  A dining table and two chairs sit off
to one side, already set for the next meal.

Gwenhwyvar's Laboratory~
A chill comes over you as you walk into the circular room and the cold
from the bare stone floor seems to seep through your boots into your body.
Although there are no windows, it seems as though there is a cold draft.  A
mixture of sweet, sour and bitter smells from the herbs kept for use as
spell components occupies the room.  Bookshelves cover the walls of the
room from midway up the wall to the ceiling.  The bookshelves are filled
with large, leatherbound tomes covered with mystical runes of silver and
gold scribed into them.  Again, no dust defaces the room.  There is very 
little furniture, save a wooden table, obviously used for preparing spell
components and studying, and chair beside it in the middle of the room.
