Entering the Amazon Rainforest~
All about you are the sounds of birds chirping, strange creatures
 howling, and the wind brushing through the huge leaves of the various
 plants surrounding you.  Stepping into this seemingly mystical and
 forbidding forest, the crunching of the dead leaves beneath your feet is
 a startling sound.  There does not seem to be any marked path in this
 jungle, but some areas seem a little bit easier to get through than others. 
 The air is warm and humid, and the sun is visible above the huge leaves of
 the palms and other trees growing everywhere.

 very far, as there seem to be a lot of high trees covering the hilly terrain.

Making your way through the tangled growth, vines and leaves slap at your
 face.  As the ground is still quite dry and crunchy, you hope that the noisy
 leaves will not frighten away any animals.  Listening closely, you hear
 what sounds like an animal rummaging through the leaves in the distance. 
 Stepping lightly, you continue on your way.

 creature.  Peering between two very tall tropical trees, you cannot seem
 to make out the form of the creature, but it sounds as if it were right
 next to you.

Realization~
At first glance, the animal you were hunting is not even visible. 
 However, you can still hear the sounds of this creature.  In a fit of panic,
 you glance everywhere, searching for the cause of this noise.  Stumbling
 over a huge tree root, you fall to the ground.  Suddenly, a sinister and
 familiar noise is echoing in your ear.  Gasping, you realize that the huge
 tree root that had tripped you is actually an enormous snake, who seems
 to be intent upon making you its midday snack!

 for many small creatures that choose to live there.  You continue on,
 wondering what kind of little animals you might encounter.

 ground has allowed you to see some very tiny footprints embedded there.

 indeed a beautiful stream, which almost looks like a small and slow
 moving river to you.

 wavy plants growing in the water, as well as many exotic looking flowers
 blooming along the edges.  Peering into the water, you notice many small
 frogs and fish that are easily accessible from the edge of the stream.

After the last encounter, you decide to step a little more carefully. 
 The branches that protrude and stick out into your face are home to many
 more frogs, though different than the ones you saw before.  Walking along
 the edge of the stream, the ground is very soft and almost squishy.  Ahead
 of you, there seems to be a large pool of water, home to a group of fairly
 big animals.

The West Shore~
This amazon pool is incredibly beautiful.  The leaves of the tall plants
 shade the pool, but the sun still peeks through, warming the clear water. 
 There are bright pink and yellow flowers dangling off of the overhanging
 leaves and branches, and brightly coloured birds far above.  The cool
 breeze still blows through the forest about you, and the sound of the wind
 rustling the leaves is a very relaxing one.

The Southwest Shore~
This amazon pool is incredibly beautiful.  The leaves of the tall plants
 shade the pool, but the sun still peeks through, warming the clear water. 
 There are bright pink and yellow flowers dangling off of the overhanging
 leaves and branches, and brightly coloured birds far above.  The cool
 breeze still blows through the forest about you, and the sound of the wind
 rustling the leaves is a very relaxing one.

The Waterfall~
This beautiful waterfall consists of uncountable gallons of water rushing
 down a rocky cliff.  Holding out your hand, you let the water run over it. 
 The water is crystal clear, cool, and refreshing.  The sun is shaded by
 some palm leaves far above, but peeks through occasionally as the wind
 gently moves them.  The waterfall goes down farther from here, and the
 ground seems as if it is miles away.  The footing is treacherous, but what
 awaits at the bottom of this natural and ancient wonder looks to be well
 worth the descent.  There seems to be an opening behind this waterfall. 
 The rocks are slippery, but maybe you can make it.

The Hidden Cavern~
This concealed lair is perfect for hiding out in.  Although the brown rock
 walls are moist with the condensation from the waterfall, the cave is
 quite roomy and is dry towards the back.  The rush of water spilling over
 the entrance of this cave echoes in a melodious manner.  The occasional
 drip of condensing water compliments the beautiful sounds perfectly. 
 This secluded cavern is very relaxing.

The Waterfall~
Having successfully scaled the slippery footholds, you are at the bottom
 of this most beautiful waterfall.  Looking up, you see an unforgettable
 scene.  The pure water of the river pouring down the rocks is framed by
 the blossoms and leaves above, while the sun again peeks through the
 leaves.  The sky is an incredible shade of azure blue, and adds to the
 stunning panorama that has unfolded before you.

The Relaxing River~
The waterfall ends here, flowing mellifluously down the stream.  Craggy
 rocks protrude from the river.  You glimpse some silver flashes jumping
 from the water, fighting the strong current that the waterfall has
 created.  The plant life seems to thicken here, making it a bit more
 difficult to navigate along the side of the river.  Perhaps it would be a
 better idea to jump in and cool off!

The Shore~
The stream seems to get thinner and thinner as you travel along, and the
 water slows down.  The plants do not seem to be as thick anymore, so you
 pull yourself out of the water.  There is a colony of very cute little bugs
 on one of the large leaves.

Ghanima's Lair~
The soothing sounds of the waterfall can still be heard.  The rock floor is
 cool to the touch.  The reddish-brown walls are decorated with some
 rather interesting paintings, and there are some classy wrought iron
 torch holders hanging from the wall.  The flames from the torches give
 the room an eery yet seductive glow.  As the flames flicker and dance the
 light in the room wavers.  In the middle of an amazon rainforest, this
 cavern is totally secluded.  It looks as if this is the lair of an ethereal
 being.

rock~
These rock paintings may have been painted by the being inhabiting this
 cave, or may be ancient and painted many years ago.  Outlined in white and
 black, they depict animals in various positions, and people engaged in
 symbolic rituals.  There is also what appears to be be a strange script.  A
 large symbol, and some other odd symbols following it.

cafe~
The Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is
 depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted
 yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and
 colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist
 has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a
 tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great
 passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker
 and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The
 most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is
 painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has
 many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to
 an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,
 each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.  Overall, this painting is an
 incredibly beautiful piece of work, and you can see why the owner had the
 good sense to bring it to this lair.

sunflowers~
This gorgeous painting, entitled simply Sunflowers is unlike any still
 life you have ever seen before.  It depicts a ceramic vase holding a dozen
 or so sunflowers.  They are not painted simply as flowers, but rather as
 individuals.  The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists
 favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. 
 Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the
 subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon
 yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these
 beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading
 Vincent.

paintings~
The room is filled with incredible paintings. There are some rather
 primitive looking rock paintings scattered about, done in natural looking
 reds and blues.  The pictures that really catch your attention are the
 bright and vibrant framed pictures. Obviously the being that inhabits this
 lair must think a great deal of the artist to have brought his works into
 the amazon rainforest to decorate this cavern.  The pictures all have
 some form of the name Vincent Van Gogh on them.  Some of the
 paintings jump out at you, such as The Cafe Terrace, Sunflowers, and
 Night Stars.  You can examine all of the art in the cave more closely.

night~
Night Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for
 obvious reasons.  It is an extraordinary piece of art.  The scene is one of
 simple pleasures.  A shoreline, at night.  Two commoners walk along the
 bank, oblivious to the painters fervour.  A small village is just barely
 visible along the horizon.  Upon closer examination, the dark foreground
 has some docked sailboats, lying dormant.  The most amazing aspect of
 this painting is the colour. The water is painted carefully, and the night
 sky above is nearly beyond description.  The sky is what could be
 described as the colour of love, according to the owner of this painting. 
 The colours, so perfectly blended from turquoise to the beautiful and
 menacing navy blue the artist is famous for, seep into your soul and uplift
 you.  The stars littering the sky are each given attention, and are painted
 with a wonderfully exaggerated golden yellow.  Each star has an aura
 about it, making it seem as if it were a galaxy of its own.  All of these
 beautiful stars are reflected on the waters surface, in shimmering rays
 of golden yellow.  The painting in its entirety raises your spirits and
 relaxes you.
