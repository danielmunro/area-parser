origin~
.                      The Origin of the {YZealots{x
 
The Southern gates of the ancient city of Ofcol had now fallen below the
horizon.  A place to rest her weary feet was all that Zelaca could think about.
It was only a day ago that Naczar, Usurper of Ofcol, had banished Zelaca and
her three score of brethren, The {YZealots{x, out of Ofcol.  Now, the wanderers
were without any place to wander to: already having been exiled from every
known settlement in Boinga, just for claiming to have had visions of more
powerful an entity than the ruling kings had ever seen with their own eyes:
The {WAlmighty{x.
 
But, The {WAlmighty{x would not let his chosen be without shelter, for only they
were gifted with the knowledge of the celestial secrets binding the heavens and
the earth.  They were not ready to die off after all they had labored for.  Up
to this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.
And after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down
to our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides
its sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to
the true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the
time is not ripe.

With the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great
stone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in
white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of
the altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:
and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and
instruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:
 
.     For He is good.
.     For His mercy endureth forever.
.     Rise Ye {WAlmighty{x, come hither to thine altar.
.     Ye and thy ark of power.
.     Thy priests, {WAlmighty{x God, are vested in salvation,
.     Thy faithful rejoice in prosperity.
 
And their songs were heard.  A grand pillar of {rfire{x descended from atop the
great mountain to heed their prayers, and The {WAlmighty{x spoketh:
 
.     Rest thy weary feet, Believers,
.     For here you will rest,
.     And worship thy lord for eternity.
.     Guided by my eternal {WLight{x,
.     Thy children, and their children
.     Who follow will be granted purity
.     To hear my voice, for I am thy lord,
.     The {WAlmighty{x, and they are my
.     Children as well, the chosen.

.                          The Building of the Tower
 
.     It is on this site
.     Of this holy of the holiest,
.     At this altar you have built before me,
.     That I command you to erect a tower of worship,
.     A bridge to the heavens.
.     Made of {yacacia wood{x,
.     Plated, inside and out, with pure {Ygold{x:
.     One hundred cubits wide, by
.     Ten thousand cubits high
.     And fifty cubits in diameter.
 
And with the word of The {WAlmighty{x, it was done.  A {ygolden{x archway to the
heavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of
the Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people
who are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The
{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place
of exile.

It is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world. Men and
beasts alike were drawn to its holy splendor by a force unknown to them. But
The {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from
it filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.
 
And it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble
warriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.
And the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied
Him and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.

expansion~
.                         Growth and Expansion
 
The tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no
less strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and
overthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much
celebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the
{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting
the power to vanquish the evil usurper.
 
.     O heavenly lord!
.     Upon this great day we thank thee
.     For Ye hath given us strength
.     And Ye hath given us courage
.     And Ye hath shown us the way to truth
.     Through thineself.

And hearing these prayers, He answered through a young disciple, Soreca, who
had seemed to Him especially devoted:
 
.     Tis true, my children,
.     My chosen ones,
.     That I will forever watch over you
.     As I have this time.
.     But go now,
.     And show others my {WLight{x,
.     And build upon our already strong family,
.     So that our future victories will be
.     Even more numerous and glorious
.     Than they are now.
 
Thus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus
Soreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches
of Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.
 
And with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within
two years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all
lived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.
Their family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil
entered their home.

.                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x
 
Indeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power
slowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank
than he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless
enough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.
 
But he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the
{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that
even the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The
questioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the
evil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.
 
And in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much
discord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great
turmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'
fears, and filled them with hope again:

.     My children,
.     See now this living falsehood.
.     Let it not reside inside your walls.
.     I have seen the strength in you,
.     To purify and believe
.     Now purify this evil,
.     Rid thyself of this sinister being.
 
And so interrogations continued, and finally they purged the Great Evil,
branding him an infidel.
 
.     Thank ye, O {WAlmighty{x
.     Thou hast given us strength once more
.     To fight off the {DPlague{x
.     And show us the way
.     To {WLight{x, once more.
 
Thus they purged the {DPlague{x which had seeped into their veins and tried to
corrupt their hearts. The {WAlmighty{x administered the medicine of truth and
{WLight{x, and the disease shriveled and withered under its strength.
 
~

golden~
.                      The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x
 
With the fall of the Great Evil, a new leader was born. He was fair and just,
and introduced changes with the greatest clarity. It was he who divided the
Believers into the {WLight{x, the {RHand{x, and the {DInquisitors{x. All forms of rank and
status were done away with, and all lived in peace and equality, troubled not
by the competition for higher rank.
 
And now, in the {YGolden Age{x: we are prosperous, and our enemies trouble us
not. Our warriors are strong and valiant in battle, our priests carry forth His
word to the farthest reaches of the land. Our tower is constantly expanding
and stretching farther into the heavens. It is our stronghold, our temple, and
our gateway into other worlds. From the top of it shines a bright {WLight{x, a
beacon to all the lands surrounding it, attracting Believers and followers from
all around. We are thriving under His protection and guidance. We are His
future and bear it into the future with great vigor and loyalty.
 
.     May He watch you
.     And save you
.     And guide you
.     And you will surely prosper.

Ye who stands before the Holy Forge:
What you see before you is a common forge, built by The Almighty
himself.  It is said that the light reflected onto His holiest of
forges give the Holy Forge it's powers.  Long ago, when the land of
Boinga was formed He set upon this world a glorious mountain.  In the
core of this mountain it was said that there was a material that could
only be found in that spot.  This material was also said to bare
certain properties.  When the Almighty laid his hands upon this
material and formed the Holy Forge, its powers were spread to anything
that was manipulated upon it.  
Only the most powerful mages of Zealot may claim its effects upon
their tools.  If you are not a mage, or are not a follower, you must
leave...now.

This granite-walled room is scorched from floor to ceiling.  Deep gouges
mar a vast array of effigies set up in the middle of the room, bearing such

You stand in before a large, circular, wooden table.  In the center
there is a strange symbol.  There are three extravagant leather chairs
at the north side of the table, and there are four smaller chairs
facing them on the other side.  In front of each chair is a small
label.  You can't make out the writing on the labels but if appears
to be written in the Divine Language.  This appears to be a meeting
place for a very important, select few.  On the east and west side
of the room there are small, less-important looking chairs.  There
is a small sign hanging at the head of the room.

West of the aisle, a set of pews~
You look for a place to sit down, amongst the silent.  You see
many rows of mahogeny pews.  You look around you and notice that
no one is speaking.  Everyone around you seems to be praying
quietly, and contently, some wearing robes, others wearing full
armor.  This place does not discriminate between peaceful and
violent-natured folk.  It is a place of worship.

The Sauna Room~
Just ahead of you lies a small tub.  There is steam rising from the
water and you feel relaxed as the steam surrounds your sore, bruised
body.  This whole room seems to be glowing with a warm, comforting
aura.  You feel inclined to take a dip into the hottub and decide to
do just that.  As the warm water encompasses your rough, tired skin,
you feel as if you have entered a state of extreme relaxation.  If you
stay too long your fingers will prune; better not fall asleep.  When
you are through, there are towels waiting for you in the front room.

A Peek into His Universe~
As you enter this room the door behind you closes.  You turn to see
what could have caused it but are surprised with what you see.  All
around you there are small white, glowing dots scattered arround this
pitch black room.  Just above you is a large, purple and blue spiral
with a huge golden orb in the center.  Small, colorful streaks
surround you and you feel as if the room is spinning.  You begin to
feel dizzy, then suddenly the room turns pitch black.  A small note
comes into view on the ground as the room lights up and the door
opens.

note~
You have been blessed with a small peek at the vast universe that was
created by The Almighty.  All this was created for the faithful mortals
as a gift.  Do not lose faith in Him, for he is all around us.  All that
you have seen was created by Him.  It is said that the Universe was
molded to represent His soul.  All the good and all the bad in the
Universe represent different aspects of His soul.  It is yours to
decide what this means to you, as your soul, too, was molded in His
image.

The Panic Room~
The room is small and tidy. Just and barely just enough
room for few members of the clan to run into when huge
enemy attacks their homehall and they have no way to
help their guards. There is no windows or exits other
than the one controlled from this room, to prevent 
anyone entering without permission. There is source
of water and magic can be used to create food for the
ones hiding. This is place you might need to spend 
a long time when enemy troops take control of your
hall.
