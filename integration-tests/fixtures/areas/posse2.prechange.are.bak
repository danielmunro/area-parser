The Entrance to the Chateau of the Posse~
It would appear that a small battle happened here.  The door looks as if
it were kicked in and those inside thrown out.  The flower garden looks
as if it had seen better days.  The building itself is rather pleasing to the
eye.  It looks like a quaint and comfortable place.  It also looks like a
nice place to hide out, or plan an ambush....

The Chateau of the Posse~
In the middle of this room is roaring fire.  It is a cozy room.  The place
has been well kept up considering it was taken by force from the
previous owners.  This seems like a nice place to kick back, relax, and
reflect on the day's battles.  Before you is a large pit.  The pit looks
perfect for storing extra equipment or making donations to those in
need.  To the east lies the Bunk House, to the west is the clan store, and
to the south is a nice outdoor garden.

The Specialty Store~
This is a really nice place. There are all kinds interesting things scattered
about the store.  The store has been well decorated and appears to be
quite clean.   I guess the store owner has friends in high places in the
Posse.  You can buy all kinds of things here.  The shop keeper has quite
good taste, but mind you all things you see here are not for sale.

The Bunk House~
It would appear that all the nice beds are in here.  Although all the
bedding has been thrown about the room,  this looks like a nice place to
sleep and heal your wounds.  There are cots, beds, and bunks all over
the room.  Some of the Posse seem to be a bit sloppy, as there are
clothes and bloody weapons strewn all over the place.  For some
strange reason there seems to be something magical about the bunk
house.  It feels as if you just heal faster in here than anywhere else.
This room just gives you a feeling of  goodness, for some that makes
you feel quite at home, but for those members of the Posse that are
more evil, this room tends to make you queasy.

The Garden~
As you step outside the Chateau you are met by the wonderful smell of
beautiful flowers.  Who ever cared for this garden was a master,
because even those with the blackest of hearts could easily find peace
here.  You can hear the singing of birds and the buzzing of bees as they
gather pollen from the flowers.  This seems to be one of the few places
that the Posse has left untouched since their arrival.  You spy a set of 
stairs leading down under a rose bush.

Posse's Portal Room~
This room has an air of anticipation about it, as though it knew you were
about to use one of its portals to hunt an unfortunate soul.  The walls
are hewn out of solid pyrite, and the floor gleams where it has been worn
from the tread of many feet.  A short ivory pillar rises from the floor,
ebony writing inscribed upon it.  Across the room from you, the wall seems
to shimmer slightly, and seems darker than the rest of the room.

Posse Mage Lab~
As you step into this room your nostrils are immediately assaulted by the
overpowering aroma of spell augmenting herbs and spices. Shelves line the
walls containing things you've only heard of in legends, artifacts of truly
awesome power, know to increase the natural magical abilities in those who
bestow powerful enchantments upon the armaments of justice. On the far wall
you see a large elegant tapestry, there is a message woven into it that reads:
 
"This tapestry hangs as a symbol of what The Posse can accomplish when they
put their minds to it. Between this magelab and our skill, everyone came
together to help raise over 140 eggs. Be proud, for we have truly lived upto
our name. Posse forever!"

A Winding Path To The Glade~
You have found your way to a small path which leads further down into
the garden. Huge oak trees surround you, whispering in tune with the 
slight, cool breeze. A small unseen creature scurries through the leafy 
undersbrush. You feel safe, and suddenly relax as you realize nothing can 
harm you here. The path takes a sharp turn to your left before dissapearing 
into the trees.

The Peacefull Glade~
You have entered an alcove of trees. The circle of trees rest on a slightly 
raised bank surrounding a shady pond. The water ripples as leaves fall on its 
mirrored surface, causing your reflection to waver. Suddenly you lose your 
bearings, and reality seems to distort slightly around you, then, just as 
suddenly, everything returns to normal.

A Cavern Beneath the Pond ~
The water clears considerably as you swim beneath the surface of the pond, 
allowing you to clearly see the marvels which lie beneath. Huge Emerald 
crystals line the cavern walls, they pulsate to an unknown rythm, giving off 
a dreamy green glow with every pulse. You suddenly realize that you have no 
need to return to the surface, you can breathe.

The Posse Observatory~
An immense glass dome can be seen through a smooth marble doorway ahead. As
you enter the doorway the dome seems to increase impossibly in size, you
suddenly realize that it is seamless and blends with the sky making
it larger than it appears at first glance. Light rays filter through the glass
creating ghost-like shadows on the deep black granite floor. Trees and
colorfull roses can be seen through the dome, they grace the bottom of the
garden and follow a path down into the glade. A doorway to the west melds with
the dome creating a tunnel to another glass room.

The Nottingham Observatory~
You walk through the short glass tunnel, emerging into a smaller version of the
main observatory. A huge golden telescope, odd in shape pierces the glass above
you. The telescope draws you in, a marvelous creation. As you put you eye to 
the scope a city suddenly jumps before your eyes, allowing you to see 
everything going on, even down to the smallest mouse scurrying along.
