Mandrake's Sanctum Sanctorium~
This room is quite large; built from massive interlocking stones. The high
ceiling is alive with dancing shadows from the room's fireplace, and you
can make out carvings in the huge wooden support beams, which depict the many
scenes of Mandrake's colorful mortal existence.
The fireplace takes up one huge section of the far wall, keeping within
its blackened interior a tame inferno which sends a warmth throughout the
room. A large wooden mantlepiece is set over it, with a set of hooks for
Mandrake's claymore. Various items adorne it, and you think you catch sight
of words carved into a small corner of the wood. You can't be sure, but you
think they say, "Rebecca is the bestest."
Scattered about the room are polished wooden chairs and tables, and wall 
hangings are decorously placed. An enormous desk is in a corner, where the
resident God does his paperwork. The well-padded chairs invite you to rest
your weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can
easily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there
before your eyes.
The carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.
A portrait has been hung over the fireplace.

E
desk~
The desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same
dark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office
chair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit 
in. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and
quite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled 
daggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung
over one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as
the enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures
under its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures
are actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.
Wait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!
Set on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn
from having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name
printed on the frame...."Rebecca".
~
E
picture, portrait, painting~
The portrait is large, framed in thick wood, inlaid with gold. The amazingly
life-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems
to be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see
enough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late
afternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom
of the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:
"My good friend, Johnwa."
~
E
tables~
The tables are dark-stained walnut with small, round tops and flowingly
carved legs in soothing patterns. A table accompanies each chair.
~
E
chairs~
The chairs are incredibly comfortable-looking, and you ache to relax in one.
They are made of a dark-stained walnut, with expertly carved arms and legs,
and are upholstered in the tartan of the castle's resident Clan.
~
E
fireplace~
The fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed
well back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside
sends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,
banishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk
inside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and
releasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in
the flickering dance of the fire.
~
E
mantlepiece~
The mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to
resist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many
small pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in
his many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and
several small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.
~
E
carvings~
There are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the
castle's walls. They show scenes of battle, and the figures depicted seem
to come alive in the flickering light. You can make out the features of some
of history's greatest warriors; Such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and
ShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in battle with the equally famous
evildoers Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, Cable, Elik, Wormy, and Power himself.

Main Hall~
This incredibly huge room is where the inhabitants of the castle and the
surrounding holdings come for feasting and general togetherness. There are
already a few people here and servants weave in and out amongst the many
tables, balancing trays laden with mounds of steaming food and clay mugs of
ale and Scottish whiskey and scotch.
The main doors are behind you. Ahead are another pair of oaken doors; a
smaller version of the huge main ones. Off to your right, half hidden by
a heavy tapestry, is a solid-looking door of burnished metal.
Another, similar tapestry on the east wall has been partially pulled aside
to reveal a darkeness around its edge.
All along the walls are smoking torches, and in between them are pieces of
armor and weapons, some with names etched into the metal. Some names seem 
familiar and you have an urge to take a closer look.

weapons , armor , walls~
You move closer to the mounted battle gear to see the names engraved
upon them. After a shield bearing a Clan crest, you see a large sword
that appears to glow with its own inner fire. It's golden hilt is forged
in the shape of the sun, and the name 'Dazrin' is etched deeply into its
glittering blade. A magnificent weapon indeed.
Another sword catches your eye, mainly because of its sheer size. Its wide
blade looks well-used and its hilt looks like it would only fit the hand of
a giant. Engraved right through the center of the nicks and gouges in the
blade's metal is the name 'ShadowCat'.
After it comes a chest plate, then a strange looking weapon. It seems to
be a dagger, but it's shaped like a starfish. At the hub of its five arms
is engraved the name 'Johnwa'.
The next mounted piece of equipment is ever more odd. You could swear the
weapon is a large set of, well, teeth! The four upper, middle teeth each
have a letter etched into then to spell the name 'Foun'. The sharpened
teeth form a macabre grin, and you wonder just where the grim warrior who
wielded these is now.

Generic extended description.
~
E
around~
The room is filled with an almost hazy light by the guttering torches placed
at intervals all arund the walls. Gleaming armor and weapons hang on hooks,
some with names etched into the battle-scarred metal. Some of the names seem
familiar. The voices of the people at the many, scattered tables is a low
murmur with the background clinking of clay mugs and the odd raucaus song.
Servants continually brush by you with laden trays and the delicious smell
of the food being served has you almost drooling where you stand. The ceiling
is lost in shadow, the broad supporting beams blackened with age and smoke.
The floor is bare wood, rough and unpolished. There are large gaps between
the floorboards, allowing spilled food and drink to fall to the stone floor
several feet down, where presumably rats and other wildlife consume it to
their own animilistic pleasure.
~
E
torch~
A torch. Duh.
~
E
tables~
The tables a placed haphazardly about the room, creating a place where any
one table can join in on the conversation of another, even across the room.
It could possibly be the acoustic properties of the shadowy ceiling, but
more likely it is a little bit of magic by the owner of the castle.
The tables themselves are little more than slabs of wood on legs with rough
benches polished to a shiny finish by years of use. The tops of the tables
are heavily scarred by gashes, spilled food and drink, and there are
hundreds of names carved into the wood; names of warriors lost in battle,
and those who have simply passed on and are remembered in song.

A few of the gathered warriors chuckle at you gaping aimlessly upwards.

At the Castle's Main Entrance~
The huge doors set into the bleak stone wall of the castle are the only
thing preventing raiders from entering the interior. Well, that and the
massive, well-armed guards standing at attention next to them, of course.

around~
The wind picks up as you examine your surroundings, making you shiver.
The castle is built several hundred yards from a cliff with a sharp drop
to the pounding surf below. The landscape is the typical craggy highland
with rolling green hills and bare outcroppings of black rock with scrawny
trees and brush interspersed among the rock, all beneath a cold, grey sky.
The castle fits right in with the rest of the scenery, its stark, stone
form pointing to the sky, unaffected by the brisk wind or uncaring elements.
~
E
castle~
The castle itself is little more than a fortress on the outside. It's cold
, dark stone walls extend straight up to the grey sky, with the occasional
slit window letting out the merest hint of light high above your head. The
interlocking stones are fitted so tightly so as to disallow the scaling of
the castle's walls. A definate sign of expert work by the builders.
~
E
doors~
The massive doors are made out of solid oak and are almost a foot thick.
They are reinforced with iron bands and the intricate carvings on their
outer sides are badly marred by slash marks, telling stories of many
repelled raiding parties.

Treasure Room~
This room is just as large as all the others, except it is just full to
bursting with all sorts of wealth as is imaginable. Jewels, rings, fine
silks, and piles of gold coins are strewn about the place like dirty
laundry. All around the walls of the room are opened chests and caskets
which spill their precious contents to join the rest of the pretties on
the floor. The walls themselves are seamless metal, buffed to a high
sheen and are almost mirrors. The light in the room is not provided by
torches like the rest of the castle, but by glowing balls of fuzzy white
energy which float about the room. Their light is reflected by the thousands
upon thousands of coins and jewels and that in turn is reflected by the
walls until all you can see is a myriad of sparks of colorful light.
The center of the room, however, has been kept almost religiously clean.
A soft, golden light comes down from the ceiling to bath a single, jewelled
dagger lying on a pedestal.
The only exit is back west.

The number of precious stones is mind-boggling. Multifaceted rubys,

remove any of this wealth would result in a most painful death. No gem is

Underneath the Floorboards~
Here, underneath the wooden boards that make up the floor of the main hall,
is a space about three feet tall, with a rich soil floor. On closer
inspection, you see that the floor is utterly clean, with no sign of the food
that continually drops through from above. Not even bones remain. You wonder
how this could be, then suddenly you have a sense of being watched, and hear
a rustling sound all around you.
In the dim light from above, you only see a way back up.

Anteroom~
This small room atop the stairs leaves just enough space for the two large
guards standing to either side of the heavy oak doors leading west, and
you. The room is brightly lit by two tall braziers in the far corners
opposite the stairs, and they make the little room just a bit stuffy.
As you make to enter the room, the eyes of the guards bore into you, taking
in every detail as their hands hover close to their large swords.

Clan War Room~
This massive room is almost indescribable. It is obvious that this Clan makes
up a pivotal fighting unit, for this war room is the best you have ever seen.
Large, incredibly detailed maps line the stone walls, and multi-colored
flags dot the miniaturized landscapes. Against one wall is a large, blank
white piece of material upon which is written various plans, strategies,
and designs for seige towers. The center of the room is taken up by a huge
oval table, thick-topped and a glossy black. About twenty chairs are placed
around it, with one more ornately designed than the others, presumably
meant for the clan's War Chief. More of the same standing braziers light
the room as well as provide a stuffy warmth.
Aside from the way you came in, the only other exits are a door to the
east, and a small flight of stairs in the far corner, leading up.

The table is simple enormous, able to seat twenty men with lots of elbow
room. Its glossy, pure black top is spotless, and while you assume it is
made from a tough wood, you can't seem to find any grain in its finish.
At each chair there is a blue folder with several sheets of paper in each,
bearing a briefing on a proposed attack on a nearby castle. You quickly
put the papers down before you are caught by someone and found snooping
~
E
white , material , plans , strategies~
This white material is strange stuff indeed. The writing can be easily
erased, and the thick writing instruments below it mark the material, but
not anything else. All over the broad board have been scrawled various
strategies for seiging castles, defending them, advancing, retreating, and
making scotch while under fire. A short line of writing 'way down in one
corner catches your eye and you lean down to see that it says 
 
"Quiver wuz here."
 
You pick up a marker to add your own line of wit, but decide against it. No
sense in risking someone's anger.
~
E
maps~
These maps have been expertly rendered to scale and even have elevations.
Tiny colored flags have been affixed all over the maps, denoting positions
of enemy castles, armies, allies, and the nearest corner store. The texture
of these maps is so realistic that you have the urge to touch them, but fear
you'd dislodge the little flags.

Castle Parapet~
You come up out onto the top of the castle, underneath a bleak, grey sky.
All around you, along the outer walls, stone blocks have been placed to
protect the people on the roof, while allowing archers to fire down upon
invaders, and to pour oil and drop rocks. Racks of crossbows and arrows
have been set up at the archers' positions, covered by oilcloth so they
don't get wet. You also notice the massive catapult in the center of the
roof, with its stack of ammunition.

cliff to the black, rocky shore where the waves pound themselves to pieces
in a mass of white froth. The sky is an almost solid grey, with clouds
jammed together in what will become a thick fog overnight. A chill wind
springs up, slicing through your clothes and armor, allowing the bitterness
of the surroundings to seep into your bones.

War Chief's Room~
This room is small, and its walls are hung with so many tapestries and maps
that you cannot see the stone behind them. The room is softly lit by a
lantern hung from the ceiling, and several thick candles are placed on the
old wooden table in the middle. Scrolls of all sizes, thick and thin, lie
piled everywhere, stuffed into drawers, crammed into corners and pigeonholes.
A smaller lantern has been placed on the table, and its glass lens has been 
focused so as to direct the light over the several scrolls and maps spread
out on the scarred, wooden surface.
As this is the private room of the Clan's War Chief, his armor is hung on a
hook in the corner, gleaming in the dim light. There is a place for his
sword, but it is covered in dust, as the Chief's weapon never leaves his side

Past the Castle~
You are on a small path just past the castle. The path turns north here,
towards the cliff. To the south you can see a field, and off in the 
distance, you think you see a great number of people gathered. A game
perhaps? Or a feast, or even a market of some sort being held out-of-doors
despite the bad weather.

At the Cliff's Edge~
Leaning forward you can see the craggy cliff face dropping straight down
to the pounding surf below. You wonder if it's possible to climb down to
what looks like a cave at the cliff's base.
A small wooden sign catches your eye.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*
 
                  kerSPLATTOOIE!!!!!
 
So, you really thought you could climb that there cliff eh? If someone
ELSE jumped off a cliff, would YOU? Well, I guess this little predicament
answers THAT one. Better have a friend come along and scrape you up off
the rocks with a spatula. You're gonna need a LOT of heal spells.

At the Edge of the Field~
Looking further south, you can see the people a little clearer, but the
activity still escapes you. There are quite a lot of men, no women or
children that you can see. You can hear them yelling and shouting, but can't
make out any words.
To the east is the cliff, which curves from the north and defines the
field's eastern edge. The field extends to the south and the west, and
the castle is back north.

sharp, black rocks prevents you from heading in that direction.

You are getting closer to the action, and you can now make out two 
different groups of men down there. Handy things those kilts.
A young man, practically a boy, runs up the field and passes you, heading
north. A minute later he runs past again, back down to the men, carrying
one of those bundles of weapons you saw. You are starting to get a sneaky
suspicion that those men aren't just training.
The field extends to the north, south, and east.

The field splits here, turning into a rocky trail that leads down the cliff
face to a small beach below. To the west is the rest of the field, but you

On the Beach~
Bleah. This is one dreary beach; definately not a choice vacation spot.
Judging by the drying strands of seaweed on the rocks strewn everywhere,
the high tide must almost completely cover the beach. To the east is the
water, and the beach continues north along the cliff base. What with all
the jagged rocks everywhere, removing your boots and wiggling your toes
in the sand is not a viable option.

Along the Beach~
You are about halfway along the beach, about where the cliff curves west
from the south, near the castle. The beach narrows considerably here, and
there are little bits of seaweed clinging to the rock face. Judging by the
discoloration of the cliff-rock, this part of the beach is about 4 feet
underwater at high tide. To the west is the towering cliff, and to the east
is the water, where you can see slippery black rocks just under the surface
where you'd break your neck if you tried to go out there.
The beach continues north and south.

Along the Beach~
Here, the cliff curves sharply to the west, and you can just barely see the
castle's parapet from here. The beach turns with the cliff, and you can see
that the tide here rises to about your shoulders. The wind has picked up
and water is rushing over your boots. The shore is very rocky here, and
you make your way carefully.
The beach goes south and curves northwest up ahead, around a large jumble
of rocks at the base of the cliff. To the east and northeast you can see
endless sea and choppy waves that grow higher by the minute.

At the Curve~
The beach is little more than a small strip of dark sand, over which washes
a continuous flow of water, coming almost to the tops of your boots. The
wind has grown very violent and whistles across the jagged cliff in a
banshee scream. The waves out in the sea to the north and east are almost
six feet high, and you are sprayed as they crash against the rocks of the
shore. The beach goes south and turns west here. To the west it thankfully
widens out again, but the waves flow over it there, too. Here, the tide
comes in well over your head. To the west, you think you see the opening
to a cave in the cliff's base.

shrieks all around you, blowing you this way and that. A wave suddenly washes
over the beach and pours freezing water into your boots. You turn to look
out to the sea, and turn white. An enormous wave is rushing towards the beach
and you! 10 feet, 12 feet, 14 feet tall...it's a tsunami! You look back the
way you came, but the beach there is already underwater...you'd never make
it in time. Looking around frantically, you see the cave entrance to the
south. It's your only escape.

In the Cave Entrance~
The floor of the cave slopes upwards drastically, then levels off. The walls
are too smooth for this place to be natural. Obviously someone built this
with the high waves in mind. Just as you reach the top of the slope, water
floods into the cave, rising almost to the top of the slope. So much for
going back out that way.
The cave continues to the south.

It's dark in here, but at least it's warm and dry. You figure that you must

walls and wonder how the maker of this cave managed to cut the rock so
cleanly.
The entrance to the cave is north, where you can hear the sound of water.
The cave continues deeper into the cliff to the south.

the cave which is back south. With the cold water to the north, and
the sharp rocks to the west, your only exits are back into the cave
south, or along the beach to the east.

The maker of this cave has smoothed out the walls entirely now, to form
a flat roof and floor, and two straight walls. It's now more of a
tunnel, than a cave. The floor of the tunnel starts to slope downwards
now, to the south. You can also go back north.

quite strong. The walls of the tunnel have started to exude some sort
of fungus, existing without the benefit of light and somehow clinging to
the utterly smooth rock. Indeed, on closer inspection, the fungus seems
to shy away from your light.
The tunnel slopes back up north, and to the south you can see that it
widens into a room of some sort.

At the Sealed Doors~
Room was an understatement. You find yourself in a massive underground
cavern. While the tunnel seems to have been made fairly recently, this
place has an air of incredible age about it. Indeed, it seems to have
been the site of several battles, as old, rusted weapons and pieces of 
armor lie scattered about the stoney rubble on the floor. Before you
rise two great doors, seemingly made out of rock, and sealed shut with
a massively thick chain whose links gleam copper in your light, despite
their great age. Along the sides of the cavern are large stone statues,
placed here to guard the great evil you sense lies beyond those doors.
As you get closer, two of the statues come to life and step forward.
As even the greatest of mages or warriors could not break that chain,
the only exit is south, or through that evil-looking portal.

Northern Edge of the Battlefield~
You are at the edge of what is definitely a battlefield, and shockingly

Here, wounded warriors are being treated or clansmen coming to pick up fresh
weapons and armor and food. Young pages run back up the field and return
with armloads of new weapons and armor as the fighting clansmen come out
of battle and quickly deplete the reserves stacked on the ground.
You want to skirt the battle, but it seems to take up the entire width of
the field. No choice then but to go back north or plow through south.

first the regular troops you encountered, and now the experienced fighters
are here, crashing their way through the defending lines of clansmen.

repress a sneeze.

Amongst the Thorns~
Looking around you at the black and twisted woods, you are caught unawares
as you run smack into a thicket of thorns and brambles that seems to have
sprouted out of the earth in front of you. The path continues west through
the brambles, and you can see that the wickedly sharp thorns are coated
with that same black, gooey substance, and you loath the thought of coming
into contact with even one of them.
Back north is the trail, and west is the thicket.

In the Thicket~
Using your weapon, you hack your way through the intertwining brambles,
wiping the blade off on the scraggly grass before the black ooze can eat
away at the metal. That feeling of evil has increased in intensity tenfold,
and you think that perhaps this wall of thorns was placed here to protect
whatever dark presence lurks beyond. As you hack your way along, you think
you can see a clear area just ahead to the west. The trail is back through
the thorns to the east.

At the Ruins~
You come out of the brambles and thorns to stand before a huge pile of stone
rubble. From the square cut of the stones still intact, and the odd piece
of metal, you guess that this is the remains of a castle similar to the one
on the cliff. On some of the stones, you can see blackened streaks, and
beneath your feet, the earth itself looks like it has been cracked and
broken by something pushing up from underneath. A wide path has been cleared
through the stones, presumably for the attacking army. The path goes west
into the ruins, and behind you, the path through the thorns goes east.

In the Yard~
You stand in the middle of a demolished castle, the stones of its walls
forming a ring of rubble surrounding the wide stone yard on which you
stand. before you is a large marble temple that seems to have pushed its
way up from beneath the castle, destroying it. The glaring faces carved
on its walls set your teeth on edge. The place is huge, with 30 foot walls
and a peaked roof which extends maybe another 20 feet higher.
Before you is a pair of bronzewood doors, sealed with a thick copper chain
and inscribed with glowing runes. You notice one of the links of the chain
has been snapped. As you approach the doors, the chain falls away.
The doors are west, and east leads you back through the rubble.

In the Vestibule~
The walls of this place have been painted with scenes of horrible evil:
disgusting acts of killing, torture, enslavement, robbery, thievery, and
some things that make your stomach curdle so that you have to look away.
Dim light filters through the dirty stained glass windows, casting
revolting colors onto the floor. There are pink-marble pillars throughout
the temple, with worm-colored veins, and you can see the main part of the
temple to the west. The main doors are to the east.

At the Main Altar~
The pillars here are a white marble with ugly red veins. The altar is a large
block of pink marble, with a hollowed-out portion on its top in the shape
of a human body, with arms and legs outstretched. The bottom of the
depression is stained a darker color. There is also a 20-foot well or shaft
here of pink marble, with crystal shards of containers, and a broken crystal
knife. Looking closer at the well, you see a ledge beginning 6 feet down,
which spirals down the wall of the shaft into darkness.
From the general look of things, there was a bloody battle here. Apparently
the good guys won and sealed the temple. However, it seems who or whatever
built this place wasn't down for the count.

in the center of the wing. In the middle of the altar is a depression about
eight feet across, and filled with a scummy black liquid. Several pieces of
broken shells are scattered about the area, as well, a broken bronze knife
lies beside the altar. The main altar is south, and there's a door to the
north.

The floor in this wing is a red slate, with broken shards of pottery and
sharp rocks littering the place, making walking a risky business.
The stump of a granite block and brownish-red rock around its base
indicate that the altar was violently assaulted and destroyed. A few
links of bronze chain and a twisted manacle add to the impression that
whoever sealed the Temple must have found this altar very hateful indeed.
A door lies to the south, and the Temple extends north.

The Grand Staircase~
A flight of steps twenty feet in diameter, broad and tall, extends
downwards and to the west into darkness. The stone is a dull gray, but
flecks of color- white, red, blue, green and black- dot its surface. To
the north of the staircase is a stone railing with supports of white, brown
and green stone alternating. The square columns here are of some yellowish
stone and are carved in bas relief and painted to show scenes of fire and
suffering with demonic creatures leering on.
Altars lie to the west and east.

High Altar~
The floor here is paved with three-foot squares of highly polished red 
granite. A huge bronze vessel, trimmed with copper stands here, its six
legs holding it over a foot above the floor. This basin-like pot is about
eight feet in diameter and its bottom is filled with old pieces of
charcoal, blackened lumps of bone, and other, unidentifiable bits. A piece
of chain hangs over this altar, and it's evident that there used to be
others once hanging there, but their bronze links were broken, and
short pieces lie on the floor. The rim of the altar is dented and
cut, as if struck by many hard blows.
To the east is a staircase, and west is a raised dais. There is a door
to the north.

The floor, steps, and walls are of a black basalt, highly polished and
gleaming. Four steps lead to the upper platform, and upon it is a great
throne of purplish basalt, with leering demon faces and carved grinning
skulls. Above the throne, on the curving back wall of the Temple, words
have been carved into the stone. Next to the throne stand four shimmering
portals, two to each side, and each a different color. From left to right:
green, red, brown, and white. Back east is an altar.

North Vestry~
This portal is finely carved, but most of the vile and obscene work has been
hacked and chopped so as to erase its evil. This chamber must have once been
the scene of debauched revels, for the remains of couches, tables, and
padded chairs are strewn about. Charcoal and several broken barrels lie
nearby. A stack of resinous wood seems to be the only thing not broken or in
disarray. Amidst the litter are several skeletons, probably human.
The only exit is back south.

As you step through the portal, you see an amazing thing happen:
The throne is beginning to sink! It is moving quickly; already it is below
the level of the dais. If you want to get on, you had better move quickly
and jump down to it before it gets too far.
However, perhaps you'd rather just go back east.

alcove, and a disgusting odor lingers about the place. Torn cloth and old
cushions are piled to form two tangled nests of bedding near the east
door. The only other exit is a door to the west.

Anteroom~
This inner chamber was evidently the room of some minor functionary, for
its walls are plastered and covered with obscene paintings. The remains
of upholstered furnishings- a couch and four chairs -are still in the
room. Some old and battered dishes are heaped upon a small table. The
only doors in the room lead north and east.

Ghast Room~
From the look of this chamber, it was once the sanctuary of some lesser
priest of the Temple. The walls are plastered and painted with scenes of
evil nature, featuring the elements of Earth. The rotting remains of a
large bed, two couches, and several carved chairs now broken, testify that
the room was once a comfortable place.
     The whole room reeks horribly. Bones are tossed here and there, and a
partially eaten corpse of some strange humanoid creature lies on the floor
near a wall. The only exit is back west.

was once the quarters of some fairly important person; perhaps an underpriest
of the Earth Temple, from the scenes depicted on the tapestries. Whatever
furniture was once here is now gone. Heaps of cloth lie near walls, showing
where inhabitants sleep. The only exits appears to be the door you came in,

walls are broken and smoke-stained from the struggles of the past. Several
couches have been shoved together to form a huge bed in one corner. A large
table and crude chair are in another corner. A big, yellowish cheese and
several hard sausages lie atop the table, beside an empty gallon jug.

sideboard is centered along the east wall. Atop it are various dirty
dishes and bits of stale bread and dried meat. The entire length of the
west wall is lined with piles of bedding, divided into eight pallets.
A small wall font still trickles a sulphurous smelling water into a stone
basin in the southwest corner. The only exits are doors to the north and

Skeletons of humans and humanoids are mixed in a terrible jumble. Many
skulls and loose bones seem gnawed. The complete skeletons, though, still
wear sundered armor, dented caps, or sprawl by broken shields. Bent and
broken weapons likewise testify to a great melee having taken place here;
a hundred, two, perhaps more...all met death here. Further progress along

Temple was surely fought in this place!

litter of tables, trestles, benches, chairs, and stools scattered and
heaped about the place show that great revelries of evil were once
conducted here. Bits of tapestries and drapes still hang here and there
from the walls. Bones and whole skeletons can be seen on the floor and
under the heaped furniture. A skirmish in the greater battle for the
Temple was surely fought in this place!
The hall extends to the east, and a corridor leads north.

The scenes on the walls here are of feasts and reveling, although done in
the evil and grotesque fashion as is the Temple's standard. There is a

In the Kitchen~
This room was obviously a kitchen of sorts. The room is littered with
broken containers and dishes, trash of an unidentifiable sort, and pieces
of wooden tables, counter tops, and the like. Several skeletons are
visible, including one which appears to be that of an ogre. A high, broad
fireplace with numerous side ovens dominates the west wall. The fireplace
is large enough to roast an entire ox, and, upon further contemplation,
probably did at one point or another. A corridor is to the west and a
door is to the north.

Hexagonal Room~
A partially destroyed stone chair dominates this place. It is hewn of
brown marble, veined with black, and stands near the middle of the west
wall. Both arms have been broken off, and the seat is chipped. A piece
is missing from the back and the whole is fractured. Rubble and broken
furniture are strewn about the room. The ceiling overhead is at least
thirty-five feet high - possibly more, lost in the shadows of the
supporting arches. The stench of rotting flesh faintly lingers throughout
the area.
The hallway is to the east and there is an exit to the west.

Augury Chamber~
This thirty-foot diameter chamber is finished in polished black stone. The
phosphorescent gleamings forty feet or so above have a bluish cast to them.
In the center of the floor is a circular depression about a foot deep and
ten feet in diameter. Around it is a low stone seat, so low that only
halflings or dwarves could comfortably sit on it - or humans if they sat
facing inwards.
There is a room directly to the west, and an exit to the east.

Black Chamber~
All of the stonework here is black, the surfaces being polished to a smooth,
glossy texture. The domed ceiling thirty feet overhead shows phosphorescent
gleams, each small dot obviously representing a star and the combinations
making miniature constellations. A broken obsidian altar stone stands in 
the center of the chamber; the place is otherwise empty. An arched exit,
about 7 feet wide and twelve feet tall, breaks the smooth curve to the
east. Upon the upper archway are carved letters in Common.
A corridor leads westward.

Niches line the walls of this musty room, in which are crypts covered with
what looks like centuries of dust. This is apparently where the remains of
the clerics who have died the service to the Earth Temple have been placed.
By the undisturbed layers of dust on the floor, it seems that no-one has
entered this place in many years.

A Storeroom~
This area was evidently one where strange and potent stuffs were once kept.
The place is a welter of smashed flasks, broken pottery vessels, glass
shards, all amidst the scattered remains of the contents of these containers
 - herbs, spices, chemicals, and other strange mixtures and substances now
unidentifiable. Even the shelves and benches which held these things are
now broken and strewn about. The wreckage is total.

Meditation Room~
This chamber is plastered and painted with disgusting scenes and adages.
It was apparently used as a restful place to which the clerics of the
cult might retreat and ponder the glories of Earthy Elemental Evil. A huge
eye is painted on the ceiling, and seems to glare down upon all in the
place. Padded benches still line the walls, and several chairs remain intact.
From the condition of these seats and the look of the floor, this ghastly 
chamber is still frequented on occasion.
The only exit is south.

The light in this thirty-foot square room comes from four large torches,
one in each corner of the room, and several large candles standing on 
long trestle tables. Also on the tables, which are flanked by long benches,
are food, drink, and knucklebones. The dishes and vessels are ordinary
pottery. Narrow three-tiered bunks line the north and south walls. The
unadorned walls and empty weapons racks indicate that this room was
originally allocated as a place to house guards.
There are doors to the east and west.

Lurid light from a flaming cresset and a glowing brazier full of charcoal

one to the north and one to the east, are barred, their doors held fast
by chain and padlock. This is where the prisoners are kept, to await
the tender mercies of the torturers. Fortuneately, they are empty.
The only exit is the door to the north.
