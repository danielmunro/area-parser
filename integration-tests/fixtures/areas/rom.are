#HELPS

0 ASSEMBLE~
Usage:   assemble <part>

    The assemble command is used to combine items with item_type 
"PART" to create a new item.  You must have all the required "parts"
in your inventory for the assemble command to work sucessfully.
Anyone can use the assemble command, and there is no skill required.

~
0 HD~
Syntax: hd

The hd (hit/damage) command is used to give you a rough idea of
how well your character hits and how much base damage your
character does.

~

0 CHARTER CHARTERS~

    Each of the organized clans have charters that dictate their
actions during PK.  Loners and Outcasts, not being organized clans,
dictate their own actions as they see fit.

    The charters are there to define your clan, and to set rules for
members of your clan to follow.  Leaders and recruiters are expected
to know these rules, and explain them in detail to new recruits.

    Charters are to be followed to the letter.
~


0 ABOLISH~
Usage:  abolish <player>

    Abolish is a Paladin-only skill that allows them to cure
diseases with a touch, by a direct act of divine intervention.
However, a Paladin's god will not grant this power frequently,
and there is a period of time the Paladin must wait before being
granted the power to Abolish again.  This delay grows shorter as
the Paladin ages and gains experience.

~

0 'CONE OF SILENCE'~
Usage:  cast 'cone of silence' <target>

This spell, if it lands, will envelope the vicitm in a cone of 
silence.  They will be unable to cast, chant, or use any of
the communication channels.

This spell requires a component.  The component can be found
on a certian dominatrix in the City of Thives.  If the casting
of this spell fails, there is also a chance that it will fire back
on the caster, causing them to be wrapped in the cone.

~
0 BOUNTY~
Usage:   bounty <victim> <amount>
         bounty show

    Bounties may be set by any clanner on any other clanner, even a 
player in your own clan.  The victim will be notified that a bounty
has been raised on him/her, but (s)he won't know by who.  The bounty
is measured in gold.  You MUST have the gold on you to set the bounty.
Bounties can be set anywhere at any time.  Bounties are cumulative,
and will accumulate until the victim is slain.  They can never be
taken back.  You may place multiple bounties on the same person.  
To see who is logged on that has a bounty, type 'bounty show'.  The
bounty will be automatically deposited into your 'gold' count once 
you kill the victim.  There are some specific rules on bounties, see
'help rules' for details.  Ignorance of these rules is no excuse to
break them or the spirit of them.

~

0 'MEDIUM'~

   The medium is a very simple kit.  The Medium is throughly connected
to the physical world, and is able to enhance the regen of anybody in
the same room.  All hit point, mana, and move gains are increased by
a ratio to the medium's level for others in the same room.  This is not
a skill, simply an inate ability of the medium.  The medium has no other
skills or abilities.  The medium does, of course, increase his/her own
regen as well, and at all times.
~

0 'WITCH'~

Warlocks and Witches are two parallel kits.  They have the same skills
and requirements.  One is for males and the other for females.  These
two kits are for mages and wizards, and are combination offense-
enhancement kits.  They receive five spells.

 immolate  :: A fire damage spell comprable to acid blast
 lacerate  :: The most damaging non-breath weapon spell in the game
 clarity   :: Enhances mana regeneraation

 arcantic alacrity :: Speeds up spell casting, even for offensive spells.
 arcantic lethargy :: Slows down spell casting for your enemies.

 Note that arcantic alacrity's affect will stack with spellcraft, 
 making Warlocks and Witches the fastest spell casters in the 
 realm.
~

0 'SHIELD OF THORNS'~
This spell, available to Druids and Elementalists, causes attackers to
take a small amount of damage when attacking you.  The spell has a 
long casting delay and large mana cost, and a comparatively short
duration.  It may be cast on anybody.
~

0 'SHIELD OF BRAMBLES'~
This spell, available to Druids and Elementalists, causes attackers to
take a moderate amount of damage when they land attacks on you.  It
does slightly more damage than 'shield of thorns', and also has a high
mana cost, long delay, and brief duration.
~

0 'SHIELD OF SPIKES'~
Sister spell to 'shield of thorns' and 'shield of brambles', this spell
has a long casting time, high mana cost, and short duration.  It does,
however, do a significant amount of damage to attackers who land their
hits on you.

a few extra attacks during melee.  If the target backstabs or kcharges
while affected by Spirit of Wolf, they'll get a third attack, but the
spell will fade immediately.  Otherwise, the spell gives a set number
of extra attacks before fading.
~


0 'SPIRIT CALLER' 'SPIRITCALLER'~

  All of the spirit spells cost some skill points, and very little 
mana.  They are also all cast very rapidly.

The spiritcaller kit is available to all races, all genders, but
only if they are druids.
~

0 'FENCE'~
Fences are the consumate sellers of goods.  They are real smooth 
operators, classy, mobster type slick guys.  They use the 
connive skill in their trade.  Fences also know about the secret
back rooms that most shopkeepers have.  This allows fences to
trade while invis or hidden.
This being said, the social stat is very important to them.

See also:  connive
~
0 'CONNIVE'~
Connive is the skill used by a fence when selling goods.  It
also allows the fence to talk their way out of "sticky" 
situations every now and then.

~

0 'SHIELD BASH'~
Syntax: shieldbash <Victim>

Available to Warriors, Blademasters, Samurai, Paladins, Berzerkers.

Shield bash stuns your victim for 1 round, and makes spellcasting
more difficult for a brief period afterwards.
~

0 'SYMBOL'~

There are four Symbol spells.  They are available to clerics and
crusaders only.  Their whereabouts and purpose are unknown.

~

0 'HAMSTRING'~
Syntax: hamstring <victim>

  Hamstring is a specialized opening move for Rogues, Thieves, and
Assassins.  Hamstring does not require any special weaponry, and it
can in fact be performed using only one's bare hands.  When successful,
hamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow
flag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung
victim will occassionally have trouble when moving from room to room.
Having high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,
but helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's
impressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short
duration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the
thief must give up on an opening backstab to use this manuever.

~

0 'ACCLIMATE'~
Syntax: c 'acclimate' <target>

   Acclimate attunes the recipient to the ambient energy of his or her
surroundings, making him/her regenerate incredibly rapidly.  If the
recipient of this spell does *ANYTHING* or takes damage from almost
any source, the spell will cancel.  The recipient must remain absolutely
still to receive the full affect.  Druids only may cast this spell.
The spell can only be acquired via spell pages.

The location of this spell page is unknown.
~

0 'RESEARCH'~

   Research is the skill that mages uses to create new spell scrolls.
The higher the skill, the more likely the mage is to successfully
craft spell pages.  Research is given automatically to all Mages
and Wizards.

   Currently most spell research must be done at the public magelab
in Midgaard, which has recently purchased a MageLab 2000 research kit.
~

0 'REGENERATION'~
Syntax: cast 'regeneration' <target>

    This is a restoration-over-time spell.  It lasts for about 4
minutes and heals a small amount of hit points during that time.
It is available to clerics, crusaders, and any hybrids that could
be old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be
found on spell pages.
~

0 'CRITICAL HIT'~

    Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes
that can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai
Berserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are
oldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They
do extra damage based on your level.

   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you
can buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced 
critical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to
a warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance
of landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'
the damage curve is softened slightly.

  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with
bash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an
additional chance to land a critical strike.

  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or
bludgeoning.  

 Example:	Cleric Paladin
	Has no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he
has basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he
has better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance
with all others, and a softer curve.

 Example:	Blademaster
	Has natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has
better chance to land a crit plus a softer curve.  If he takes 'cleave',
he gets a REALLY good chance to crit with slashers, improved chance to
crit with everything else, and soft damage curve.
~

0 'ENHANCED CRITICAL' 'CLEAVE' 'BLUDGEON'~
See 'CRITICAL HIT'.
~

0 'SUNBURST'~
Syntax: cast 'sunburst' <target>

    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,
not fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the
intense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid
blast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.

   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have
determined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.
~

0 'SONIC BLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'sonic blast' <target>

    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in
a concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does
slightly less damage than the standard Boingan spell 'acid blast'.   It
has the potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of
combat.

    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at
the New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may
have escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.
~

0 'ADAMANTITE SKIN'~
Syntax: cast 'adamantite skin'
 
    Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'adamantite skin' is a special
type of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as adamantite.
As the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,
even magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,
until eventually it vanishes completely.

    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained
from spell pages.  The pages must be researched at the public mage
lab.  The formula for the adamantite page can be found at the same 
location as one of the ingredients.
~

0 'INCINERATE'~
Syntax: cast 'incinerate' <victim>

    Incinerate is identicle to the 'acid blast' spell, except it does
fire-based damage.  Incinerate is available to mages and wizards only.
It must be researched at the mage's guild in Midgaard.  The formula
to create the spell scroll can be found at the magelab.
~

0 'STEEL SKIN'~
Syntax: cast 'steel skin'

	Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'steel skin' is a special
type of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as steel.
As the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,
even magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,
until eventually it vanishes completely.

    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained
from spell pages.
~

0 'DIAMOND SKIN'~
Syntax: cast 'diamond skin'

	Diamond skin is available to Mages and Wizards only.  It
transforms the flesh of the caster to a diamond-like substance
capable of repelling all damage.  Each attack lowers the duration of
the affect until eventually it fades completely.

    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained
from spell pages.
~

0 'SHIELD OF FAITH'~
Syntax: cast 'shield of faith'

   This self-only spell is available to Clerics, Crusaders, Paladins,
Druids, and Monks.  A shimmering shield of protection is draped over
the shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb
the next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks
it absorbs depends on the casting level of the caster.

    This spell belongs to no spell group.  It may only be learned via
spell pages and the Ritual.
~

0 RITUAL~
Syntax: ritual
 
   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.
 To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that
 has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.
 The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being 
 successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.
 A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform
 the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes
 it more difficult.  

 If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his
 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell
 after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never
 lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.
 It does not belong to any spell group.

 The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which
 is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether
 or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have
 only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.

 The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have
 to use study command.
~

0 STUDY~
Syntax:  study <scroll name>

This command only works if your oldclass is mage.  It does one thing:  
copy a spellpage.

If the study attempt  is successful, the caster will receive the spell 
in their 'practice' and 'spells' list.  Once you have enscribed it, the
the spellpage is no longer needed.  The learned spell can be practiced
and used like any other spell.  It does not belong to any spell group.

See Also:  ritual, 'spell pages'

~
0 'SPELL PAGES'~
Spell pages are special scrolls that are found throughout the land of
Boinga.  They enable an oldclass mage or cleric to learn a new scroll
without having to gain the scroll from a Guildmaster.

See Also:  ritual, study

~
0 'REMOVE DISEASE'~
Syntax: cast 'remove disease' <victim>

  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter
damage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only
be learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It 
belongs to no spell group.

  Remove Disease is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and
Paladins.  It attacks disease-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT
work on plague or other non-DOT disease spells.  Remove Disease will weaken
the DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Disease gets rid
of the DOT entirely.
~

0 'REMOVE POISON'~
Syntax: cast 'remove poison' <victim>

  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter
damage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only
be learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It
belongs to no spell group.

  Remove Poison is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and
Paladins.  It attacks poison-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT
work on 'poison' or other non-DOT poison spells.  Remove Poison will weaken
the DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Poison gets rid
of the DOT entirely.
~

0 SURNAME~
Syntax:	surname <name>

  Characters who have reached level 35 may select a surname.  This name
  must conform to the same rules as first names.  You may have the same
  surname as another character if you wish.  Nobody owns a surname, and
  nobody has to have your permission to use yours.  Surnames can only be
  changed by an IMMORTAL once set.  This is not normally done unless your
  surname is inappropriate, or your character gets married and wishes to
  take the surname of his or her spouse.  Surnames are only displayed in
  your score and the who list,  and serve no purpose but for roleplaying 
  and fun.

  You can toggle whether or not you see surnames in the who list by 
  using "brief surname."

~

0 PREFRESH PFRESH~

Q: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?

A: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters
   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to
   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters
   to "refresh" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that
   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will
   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years
   and put everyone on a level playing field.

Q: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?

A: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you 
   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken
   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all
   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish
   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation
   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you
   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.
   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,
   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.
   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if
   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal
   creation.

Q: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What
   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after
   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?

A: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are
   being discussed include giving out "xp vouchers" for the left over xp,
   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally
   decided, the answer will be posted here.

Q: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?

A: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through
   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this
   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc
   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using
   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can
   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so 
   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.

Q: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,
   what good are they?

A: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to 
   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you
   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will
   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices
   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.

Q: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.

A: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending
   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can
   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills
   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new
   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that
   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be
   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it
   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if
   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.

Q: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?

A: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take
   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the 
   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.

Q: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my
   practice sessions that way?

A: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain
   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up 
   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your
   practice sessions.

Q: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and
   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?

A: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your
   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal
   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,
   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find
   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.

Q: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?

A: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair 
   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all 
   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a "stock"
   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly
   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special
   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special
   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted
   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of
   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will
   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.

Q: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?

A: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing
   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we
   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you
   chose to change races.

Q: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available
   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?

A: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and
   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for
   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes
   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an "old class".
   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level
   and a few other things like delays on skills.

Q: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?

A: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the
   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5
   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,
   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're
   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will
   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort
   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.
   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more
   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be 
   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.

Q: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want
   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan
   system?

   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can 
   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be 
   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used
   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader
   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change
   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,
   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan
   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).

Q: What about my Mutant characters?

A: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,
   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not 
   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain
   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once
   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to
   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you
   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.

Q: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I
   think of something not covered in this help file?

A: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had
   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be 
   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that
   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially
   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding
   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an
   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either
   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the 
   Admins.

FINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of 
            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note
	    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider
	    adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.

0 MYRMIDON~

Myrmidon
Concept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.
The military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the
martial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,
and the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.
However, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat
and is a skilled and powerful fighter.

Benefits: 
* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already
when he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.
* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,
myrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second
and third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending
on the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.
* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a
fourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon
and level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the
time, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of
the time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.

Drawbacks:
* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less
familiar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they
fight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different
size (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).
This penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.

0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALIZATION~
Syntax: specialize <weapon>
	specialize help (displays this help file and costs)

Specialization is an option available to warriors and warrior reclasses
Specialization offers the warrior a better hitroll, more damage, and a
remote shot at an extra attack.  Warriors and Blademasters may specialize in
anything.  The warrior reclasses may specialize as follows:
 
 Samurai: sword, polearm, dagger
 Berzerker: sword, mace, axe
 Paladin: sword, flail, mace

Note: In order to specialize, your oldclass must be warrior. IE a cleric
      paladin cannot specialize, but a warrior paladin can.

 ~
0 PAB 'PLAYER ADVISORY BOARD'~
The player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.

Each clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.

Meetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.

Imm currently in charge of the PAB: Hobkin

Mortals on the PAB have the PAB flag next to their names.


~

0 PYROTECHNICS~

The pyrotechnics spell group involves the creation of explosive materials.
Its use is currently limited to samurai, monks and assassins. The spells 
are very powerful.

small bomb: a small explosive device explodes on the target
high explosive: blasts opponents with a larger bomb
smoke screen: obscures vision and allows an escape from combat

**NOTE: Only Monks,Assassins and Samurai's get Smoke Screen **
~

0 NETHERMANCER NETHERMANCY FADE~

   The Nethermancer is the most mysterious and unpredictable of spellcasters.
Through the art of {Cnethermancer{x, this kit can transfer hp to mana and vice
versa as needed, at an exchange rate of 2::1.  This conversion is automatic.
A perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana
reach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and uncontrollable ability to 
become completely invisible at will.  He cannot control when this happens and
when it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in
combat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,
the Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,
called the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer
manages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically
outfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use
the "outfit" command to get another set.  

Nethermancers cannot wear armor.
Armor is defined as any item whose item type is armor.
~

0 BLADESINGER BLADESONG~

Syntax: Bladesong
        Bladesong stop

   The Bladesinger is a special type of elf combatant.  Through the use of the
{Cbladesong{x skill, the elven bladesinger receives a variety of bonuses in
combat, as well as up to a 25% chance for an extra attack during each combat
round.  Bladesong can only be performed with a sword or dagger, and cannot be
used if the bladesinger is wearing a shield.

   Bladesong stop will end your deadly dance with the blades.
~

0 BATTLERAGER 'KILLING RAGE'~

  The Battleragers are the elite corps of dwarven warriors.  Ragers are 
unstable at best, flying into insane fits of intense rage.  They can actually
inflate their own hit points through the use of the {Ckilling rage{x, as well
as receive a variety of other combat bonuses, including a chance at an extra
attack during each combat round.  Battleragers can only perform the {Crage{x
when wielding an axe, and cannot see their own hit point count while affected
by the rage.
~

0 DAETOK~
  Syntax: daetok

  Dae'Tok is a Yinnish fighting style that cannot be learned by any other race.
It involves a style of trainin that Yinn are taught from childhood, and results
in spectacular accuracy and maximum potential for damage with any form of 
weapon.  All Yinn become better with this skill as they advance in their
careers.  Dae'tok increases both the hitroll and damroll, and increases the
chances of landing {Csecond{x and {Cthird{x attacks.

~

0 RANGERS~

  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  As such, (s)he fights most
effectively in nature - plains, forests, hills and mountains, and is
uncomfortable and ill-at-ease when indoors or in urban areas.  All rangers
may declare a species enemy (see {cSPECIES ENEMY{x), and will receive bonuses
when fighting against any player or creature of that species.  The ranger's
dislike of his/her species enemy is so strong that those creatures are 
penalized in defensive skills when defending against the ranger.  Rangers may
move from any sector to any sector for one movement point, and receive +3 
moves when they level.  They also may dual wield with any combination of
weapon types.

NOTE:  When the material table is complete, Rangers will be forbidden from
wearing armor made from non-natural materials.  This means they'll be 
restricted to leathers, cloth, wood, and the like.
~

0 'SPECIES ENEMY'~
Syntax: species <race>

   Rangers do not have to declare a species enemy, but the cost of this 
feature is included with the price of the kits, they pay for it whether they
use it or not.  The species enemy must be a PC race.  Once you pick one, you
can never -ever- change it.  Select wisely.  Rangers fight remarkably well
when going up against their species enemy, and members of that race don't
defend as well against the ranger.  You may not declare your own race as your
species enemy.

0 'GETTING STARTED'~
MHS Newbie Tutorial

   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,
many of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or
mudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first
things you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The
"score" command contains most of the relevent information about your character.
The "worth" and "attrib" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes
lines seperately.  The "who" command lists all the characters that are logged
in right now (that you can see).  Type "equipment" to see what gear your
character is currently wearing.  The "inventory" command lists the things that
have on you but are not currently using.  We recommend that you go through
the newbie school (type {crecall{x, {cup{x, {cnorth{x to get there) to get
a good head stat.

MHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2 

TRAINS and PRACTICES
   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By
gaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and
use new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will
begin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills
will naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing
them.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will
eventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which
this happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you
need to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the
signs to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your
class to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1
{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).
Simply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill
that you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will
increase by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you
practice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.
The highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything
beyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.
You begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time
you level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x
sessions you receive.

   Your character also has 5 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her
abilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x, 
{Ywisdom{x, {and {Yconstitution{x.  See the individual help files for each 
for detailed information on how they affect your character.  {YAttributes{x
start at a specific value depending on what race and class you selected. To
improve your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x session.  You begin with 3
{Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more every time you level.  Your
{Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually start out between 10 and 15.
You will want to train your {YCON{x and {YWIS{x first.  This action also
requires a trainer.  There is one in the newbie school.  These trainers are
not always the same as the {Gpractice{x trainers.

MHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3

LEVELS and RULES CHANGES
 
   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,
you'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you
will nol onger be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in 
the world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of
his/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will
until level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts
(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about 
these changes as you approach level 11.

   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called
"levelling gear."  Anything can technically be "levelling gear", but this
term generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about
to level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,
and {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).
Where do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best
bet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to 
reach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less
experience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters
to slaughter that are more of a challenge.

0 SPELLCRAFT~

   Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied
the metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able
to identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class
or not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,
can sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a
variety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid 
spellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.
~

0 BANKS BANKING DEPOSIT WITHDRAW~
Syntax: deposit <#>
        withdraw <#>

   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be
found on clan road.  You may only deposit eggs into the bank, and they
must be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs
in the bank is listed in your score.  You do not collect interest and 
there is no minimum balance.  Your eggs are completely safe in the bank.
Notice that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal your
eggs when you go to deposit/withdraw them.  The bank is not responsible 
for stolen eggs.  

~

0 COLOR COLOUR~

   Syntax based on Lope's standard colour code.

   To enable color, type "color on".  To disable, type "color off".

   This SLED automatically colorizes some elements of the game.  If you do
not like our colors, do not turn color on.  If you want to use only a few
parts of color, get a client and utilize its color features.

   You may use the following in any place to create color; notes, titles,
tells, channel use, any where.  Please note that if you do not reset the
color to 'normal', your color will bleed.  If you do this, you will be 
frozen, so be very careful.

    Red:    {{r for {rnormal{x, {{R for {Rbright{x
    Blue:   {{b for {bnormal{x, {{B for {Bbright{x
    Green:  {{g for {gnormal{x, {{G for {Gbright{x
    Yellow: {{y for {ynormal{x, {{Y for {Ybright{x
    Black:  {{D for {Dblack{x,  {{W for {Wwhite{x
    Cyan:   {{c for {cnormal{x, {{C for {Cbright{x
    Magenta:{{m for {mnormal{x, {{M for {Mbright{x
    NORMAL: {{x resets colors to normal.
     
    Proper use of color:

    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS{{x!
    <100/100hp> whois me
    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS{x!

    Improper use:
    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS!!!
    <100/100hp> whois me
    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!
    <100/100hp> whois me
    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!
    <100/100hp>
    {x

    Get it?  If not, don't use it, please.  We don't issue warnings for
    stupidity.

0 TRADE TRADING MUDTRADER~
MudTrader 1.1

Syntax: trade <cmd> <arg1> |amount|

Command Summary
> trade request <character>	 	- Start a trade 
> trade accept <character>		- Accept a request to trade
> trade decline <character>		- Decline a request to trade
> trade clear				- Clear the current trade
> trade cancel				- Abort current trade
> trade add <item in inventory>		- Add something to the trade

> trade remove <item in trade>		- Remove an item from the trade
> trade remove <gold|silver> <amount>   - Remove money from the trade
> trade show				- Display current trade
> trade approve				- Finalize trade

MudTrader is a special program that lets the MUD software act as a
third-party agent between two players who want to trade something,
or purchase something from each other.  When you are trading, the money
and items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove
the items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,
you get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other
person and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type
"trade approve" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type "trade approve"
for it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or
removing stuff from it, both people must type "trade approve" again.

-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'imm') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 52
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

-1 ECIRAVA~
Since the sun first shined down upon Boinga, there have always been
a few individuals that are encompassed by their extreme desire for
wealth, power, and position.
 
These covetous individuals of Boinga have joined together to form
Clan Avarice.  Their universal greed is the strongest bond between
any of the existing clanners.
  
Avarice is a highly selective clan, who tends to keep its numbers
low.  The exclusivity is derived from the clan's lack of trust in
outsiders, and a desire to have a large market that can be used
in amassing great wealth in the name of the Avarice clan.
   
Entrance Requirements:
 -Must be level 20+
 -Must have the steal skill (above 75%)
    
Avarice's great power and wealth must be protected at all costs.  In order
to ensure that only loyal members to the cause of Avarice are gulded, expect
tests of your abilities and quests to prove your faithfulness if you
choose to join the ranks of Avarice.

Avarice Charter (rules)
    
 -You MAY attack anyone of a thief-based reclass (thief, rogue, assassin,
  berzerker, monk)
 -You may NOT attack anyone who is not a thief-based reclass.
  EXCEPTION:  You are allowed to attack to aid a clanmate who has
    been attacked.  Note that this doesn't mean you can attack your
    clanmate, but you may attack anyone who is attacking them.
 -You do NOT group with those outside of your clan EVER. 
 -You do NOT help those outside of your clan for free.
 -Read those again.  Avarice does not trust outsiders be they clanners
  or non-clanners.  You may sell items and services, as this is part 
  of your clan ideals.  But you are not Matookers or Honor.
 -There will be no alliances with any clans.

See 'help avarice sanction' for sanctioning information.

Avarice is not a sin, it's a way of life...
~

-1 HONOR~
It is a time of ideals,
of leaders, of followers,
of love, of friendship,
of life, of death, of truth...
of HONOR!!

We are truly now the new generation of HONOR clansmen and women.
Our forefathers began the quest for justice and truth a millennia ago, 
on the plains of Northern Midgaard. Blood and tears were shed to regain 
HONOR once lost, and alas, is lost once again!!

In the past Clan Honor's strength in numbers allowed for victory, but at a 
great cost in lives. The evil were caught, drawn, quartered and hung.
These old reminders remain there even today, remember my brethern...the 
folly in betrayal, and the swift hand of vengeance!

CLAN HONOR's ideals come from the very heart of it's members. We exist to 
purge this realm of evil that exists in the minds and souls of many, and as
it seems leads more into its grasp every day. We must stand strong together
to strive to assist our own, no matter what the cost, especially in 
accomplishing the first goal.  

If YOU believe in yourself, in truth, in HONOR, and wish to join the family 
called HONOR, you must first send a note to 'HONOR' stating your intentions.
You will also be responsible for petitioning a Knight, or Lord to direct
you to the person who will give you your quest. Expect a rigorous interview,
and a test of your skills!

Stand strong together my brethern, for the paths of false HONOR may lead to 
your own death!

"May the light of HONOR show you the true paths to glory..."

Entrance Requirements:

* None

======================Honor Charter (rules)================================

* Grouping or Working with any member of Demise is forbidden.

* Members of Demise are to be killed on sight.

* If you are asked for help, you will provide it if you are able.

* Thievery is not honorable, if you get a thief flag expect to be
  sanctioned.

-1 WARLOCK~
In the land of Boinga, in a time forgotten by most, there was a spellcaster
whose name has also been lost. He was travelling the land and noticed that
there was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'
comprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters
so as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his
faithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that
had the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and
his brethren were made to pay with their lives.

Here we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials
of time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our
plight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide
into three sects.

Those who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through
kindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain
knowledge of the magical arts.

Those who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help 
with clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to
recruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.

Those who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to
punish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our
clan against those who would wage war. 

Our goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for
all those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will
put you in touch with our recruitment officers.


Entrance Requirements:
  
* You must be a pure spellcaster
  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)
   
Warlock Charter (rules)
*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:
   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader
   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.

*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.

The Legion of the Goblin Hoard.
Long ago a new race was formed, offshoots from the human race, the Goblin
came into being. They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their 
race going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to 
the lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became 
obvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend 
off the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.

The Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.
If you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of
races far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.
The Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.
Any race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become
anything more then just a guardsman.

If you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must
contact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one
on-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed 
around roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan. 
If you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of 
protecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited 
the weak for this task.

LONG LIVE THE LEGION!

The Clan Circle

    "As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.  We are the Keepers of
Magic.  We are the Magi of Clan Circle, Never Ending and Ever Lasting."

    Magic.  It is the lifeblood of the universe.  It is magic that drives
us, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief
of clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-
come.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development
and increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and
strength.

    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in 
which we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,
corpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a
clan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,
the Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle 
are the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and
willing to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.

    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying
that is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per
the basic "no multiplaying" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay
and develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income
is also encouraged but not required.

Circle Leadership and Law

    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are
elected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in 
Circle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle
are given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect 
that all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.

Joining Circle

    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,
and we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves
are welcome to apply for admission.

    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must
have at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.
Because dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells
are considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.

    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle
or Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post
a note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All
applicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to 
complete a quest.

-1 LONER~
Loners are individualists, standing alone from any Clan, but subject
to the same rules as clanners with respect to pkilling, pstealing,
and transportation spells.  By definition, Loners have no common
hall, no leaders, and no affiliation among each other, save what they
agree upon for themselves.

To become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5
and 20.  This command -cannot- be reversed under any circumstance.
Do it carefully.
~

-1 ECNALAB~
In life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and
those who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the
land of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once
stepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to
follow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were
part of the family of BALANCE.

In the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and
able to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's
slave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to
become what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk
among us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation
Balance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling
that they took precedence over the many...

And so this continued until one day few were left. They decided
to make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than
follow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would
have sheep rather than friends.

With that Balance was reborn!

Balance is a family of members, none being any more important than
any other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant
state of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above
others.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they
will give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member
is one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This
is so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before 
completing entrance into our clan.

The Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.
The speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the
spokesperson to the outside world.

Children of Demise

        Darkness swallows light, death extinguishes life, and hope is but a 
foolish dream. All things must come to an end, and the Children of Demise
faithfully help the end come quicker. We willingly bear the burden of life,
so we can help the unbelievers on into the everlasting darkness. To enter
the darkness serving the faith is the greatest priviledge. To crush all
hope and happiness is one the many steps to our eventual success.
I, Eiji, am the father of Demise. I have come forth from the shadows to bring
the words and wisdom of Demise. There is no stopping our tide. We shall 
prevail.

Clan Demise

        Clan Demise consists of a cult with a inner hierarchy. You rank
is based on your level, your acts in the name of Demise, and your Role-
playing. Clan Demise allows pking, pstealing, and other cruel activities.
We work together as a tight unit, planning carefully all ventures.
If thou wishest to join Demise, expect a serious questioning from members.
They tolerate no stupidity, foolhardiness, or insolence.
ROLE-PLAYING is a MUST.
~

-1 DEMISE~
Above, in the planes of the Deities lies one of true evil.  His power is fueled
by destruction and vengeance that are channeled through the wrath of his 
glorious children!  We are the Children of Cthon!  Spawns of Hell, Delivers 
of Death, Vengeance and Chaos.  We are the elite army of the greatest 
power.  We bare the burden of life to crush all hope and extinguish all life, 
making Cthon ever so much stronger! 

Those within our ranks have the privilege of serving the greatest evil.  As such
Cthon himself grants the elite army with speed and aura of fear that makes 
our enemies cower in fear with our power!  Possessing so much power we 
harness it and war with every existing clan, loner and outcast.  No treaty or 
bond between clans is powerful enough to stop our storm,  for we come for 
you?always. In the words of wisdom of Eiji, the father of Demise, "There is no
stopping our tide! We shall prevail!"

Clan Demise

To enter Clan Demise is a feat in itself.  Do not come looking for us.  We 
will come to you.  Show us your power by killing and looting.  Any attack 
on you consider it a test.  You must also be a minimum of level 15, and  
even then, when we feel you are ready you fill be asked to join and no 
sooner.

Clan Demise is a cult of inner hierarchy, in which your rank is on the basis
of your level,  your acts in demise, and other cruel activities.  If you do not
maintain your power and skills you will be outcasted and hunted by your 
former clan.  No stupidity, foolishness or insolence is allowed, and  
role-playing is a must.  

Entrance Requirements:

* You must have a Thug or Killer flag

Demise Charter (rules)
{YGROUPING{x or {YWORKING{x with anyone outside the clan is *expressly* 
forbidden! If they are in your range, kill them!!!

-1 ZEALOT~
Zealot....

"Blessed are we, the Children of the Almighty, for we will live to see His
eternal paradise brought upon Boinga.  Let us pray..."

The words of the Almighty are spoken, and his children wake, and listen.
These children are known for their devotion to the Almighty, the one
true God of Boinga. Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old
alike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false
faiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse
the lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan
men.

These children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound
heart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:

Zealot.

The faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the
false faiths of the lands through any means necessary.

Noone shall be considered neutral.  All will fall before the might of
the Almighty!

Entrance Requirements:
None

Zealot Charter (rules)
You may not group with or work with any other clanners.  They all
serve false gods.  You may work or group with nonclanners as 
their gods have already been conqured by the Almighty and they are
only humoring themselves.

~
-1 'ZEALOT RANKS'~
----------------------------Ranking----------------------------

/1 The Light of the Almighty. [*]
The members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading
the teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to
the heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow
brethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching
of new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the
cleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.
They also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.

/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]
The members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of
eliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen
filth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.
The creed: "There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of
blood." is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to
heart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this
is not their main task.

/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]
These members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention
when the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report
directly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the
congregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime
tasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of
funds of the clan.

All Ranks: Inquisitors.
Due to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the
clan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within
the clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed
are weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or
directly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which
might be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?
That knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.
All inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any
inquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,
or become an outcast at worst.

Ranks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated
as such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become
boastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,
and is highly frowned upon.

/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory
The Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.
These select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given
responsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own
branch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report
directly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the
clan.

/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.
These chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within
the church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct
voice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.
These people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek
advice on internal matters as they so choose.
~



-1 POSSE~
A band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,
killing, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band
were a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams
and death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they
formed a Posse.

The Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about
the world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and
RUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.

Posse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,
THIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.
Taking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the 
above flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the
understanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also
that accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident
will be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually
unacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an
outcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating
circumstances, again as the situation dictates.

We are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that
we help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups, 
or even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry
flags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our
greater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.

Posse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races
and classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.
Players are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to
not invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.
Teamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not
required.

Sanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble
following the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and
will generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5
you ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time
they will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how
long they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to
remove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:

Ruffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer
Thug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.
Killer and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked. 

Entrance Requirements:

* You may not have a flag (see definition below).

Posse Charter (rules)

- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),
  is to be killed.
- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for 
  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.
- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.
~
-1 SREDIR REDIR~
And when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was
given unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its
inhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great
sword...

And behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair
of balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of
dust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which
nourishes the body--and the spirit...

And lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose
arrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to
disfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...

And behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell
followed with him...

And power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with
the Sword, and with Hunger, with Disease, and with Death...And lo there was a
great earthquake; and the Sun became as black as sackcloth, and the Moon became
as blood, and the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth...

For when the great day of His wrath has come...who shall be able to stand?

MAKE WAY FOR THE APOCALYPSE...

[Premise]
We are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we
are but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or
destruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our
purpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably
must, and will be.

Those who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience
with the proper Incarnation.

Warriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.
Thieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.
Clerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.
Mages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.
~

-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~
Outcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They
are, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in
their lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are
a few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:

-- Attacking a fellow clan member
-- Stealing from a fellow clan member
-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan
-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership
-- Receiving a DWEEB flag
-- Spying for another Clan
-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention

Once someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless
a voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs. 

~

-1 DWEEB~
Dweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the
gods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be
attacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can
bestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for
a Dweeb flag:

-- Continually spamming the public channels.
-- Continually harrassing particular players.
-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.
-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.
-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.
-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.
-- Using CB lingo on public channels
-- Using l33t speak on public channels
   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use
    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)

Note that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings
before you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to
have done something truly horrendous.

Also, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the
period of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you
must live with it.

-1 MATOOK~
Help 'Matook'
Matook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest
in dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they
can.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse
retrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the
individual is willing to do.

The helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church
in the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many
helpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing
and mana recouperation rooms for the needy.

If you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to
join their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and
knowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of
the Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be
willing to answer any further questions about the the Church in
general and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any
area. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference
is always forbidden.

"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's
fate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease."

-May Matook Protect You.

  |  Welcome, mortal, to Moosehead SLED!  Please note that MHS has  |  
  |  been put back into a state of change after a long static       |

  |  and may contain erroneous information.  The 'help rules' file  |
  |  is kept as up-to-date as possible, please read it and ask us   |
  |  a question if something doesn't make sense.  Please note the   |
  |  existance of the Question/Answer channel.  You should try that |
  |  channel first if you have questions.  Please be patient if no  |
  |  one responds to you, spamming your question will only irritate |
  |  others. You also have access to the Newbie channel, as long as |
  |  your newbie flag remains, this channel can help you talk to    |
  |  other newbies for help and suggestions. We recommend that you  |   
  |  go through NEWBIE SCHOOL first  if you are not familiar with   |  
  |  MUDs.  Some imporant commands to get you started:              |

You will stay calm.
You will stay quiet.
You will let the mortals play the game.
You will ignore their complaining.
You will not respond, even when goaded on.
You will keep policing them to a bare minimum, always.
Leave them alone, they will leave us alone.
Restrings and quests and that stuff is still VERY cool.

Ignore these directives and you will not be an IMM.

Moosehead has gone through a state of Player Refreshing. This character has
not yet been refreshed. If you 'continue' you will go through parts of the
creation process allowing you to change parts of your character to better
balance you within the game. If you 'quit' this character remains unrefreshed
and you can do it at another time.

You can test pfreshing a character by logging into the OLC Port instead of
here with this character. Login to sled.moosehead.com port 8080. Once you
pfresh a character on port 4000 you can not undo or retry it.

If you have any questions as to what this process involves we recommend
'quit' and create a new character and read 'help pfresh' once you are in
the game and ask questions of the other players and Immortals.
~

52 JOBS~
As an Immortal on MHS, there are certain things expected of you, and
especially as a newer immortal, you should be mindful of exactly what
it is you're supposed to be doing.  Below is a short summary of what's
expected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.

Note:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.

All levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is
cheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of
a higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings
with mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as
you would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of
an Immortal.

52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive
or have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,
save to follow the same rules as everyone else.

53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an
Immortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how
you act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if
you are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be
placed at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the
rules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the
land, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of
being an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob
strength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking
questions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.

55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available
to you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'
stage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level
where you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be
given a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations
at this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn
OLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.
You have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any
major decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced
Immortal.

57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to
Immortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used
to penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you
should have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,
and a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at
this level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,
build on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.
Your conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but
you're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'
once you've reached this point.

58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp
of the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any
situation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to
Senior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some
of the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all
Immortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected
for their dedication to MHS.

59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still 
keeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have
their hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available
on MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,
you have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,
or you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure
about, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS
inside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins
are also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new
code for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.

60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor
is, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...

~

-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~
You may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are 
more than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim
is not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF 
or DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more 
than 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above 
actions you will recieve a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.  
Also other players may get to attack you.

There are specific ways to get certain flags:
(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a 
     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you
     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another
     player while you have no other flags.
(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged 
     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who 
     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to 
     another player.
(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This 
     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This 
     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending 
     on the number of players killed as a thug.
(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in 
     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you. 
     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of 
     another player.  When attacking somebody who origionally isn't 
     able to attack you, that person gains the right to attack you 
     until they have killed you.

Is it worth it?  You decide.

                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of MHS **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!

-1 PUFF~
No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
                (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
                (chorus)

-1 CLIST~
This is a list of currently active clans on MHS.  For more details,

a clan leader or recruiter (denoted by a rank of /5 or /4, respectively)
~

-1 RULES~
These are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.

* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and
  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be
  tolerated.

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
  Please MAIL these bugs to: cascadia@nventure.com

* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT
  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned
  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.
  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are
  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights
  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.

* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.
  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or 
  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa
  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other
  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. 

  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or
  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie
  without their permission still is illegal.

* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.
  This includes using a script away from your terminal.
  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.
  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you
  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your
  typing woes, not play your character for you.

* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, 
  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 
  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under 
  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are 
  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that 
  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,
  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special
  privileges. 
  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know
  who someone's "alt" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over
  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are
  seperate.

* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait
  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between
  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait
  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.

* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.
  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.
  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.
  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too

 (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from
  a pfight then dont take it.)

* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless
  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with
  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the
  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.

* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and
  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for 
  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are
  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that
  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To
  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob
  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with
  them do not help them level.

* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to
  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.

* Channel "spamming" and personal attacks on someone over public channels
  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to
  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse
  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,
  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.

* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly
  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you
  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised
  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.

* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave
  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while
  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill 
  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT
  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.
  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal
  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less
  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.

  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)
  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)
  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go
   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).
 
* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be
  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have
  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to 
  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage
  character shall be denied.

* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow
  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is 
  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.

* Other rules for clanned players are found in "Help Clan"

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and
  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent
  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) 

* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty
  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for
  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could
  increase the duration of your penalties.

* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.
  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs
  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when
  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base
  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on
  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:
  http://www.mudconnector.com/

* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same
  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break 
  these rules.

* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you
  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means
  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in
  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your
  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are
  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.

* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential
  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so 
  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing
  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or
  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts
  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections
  are logged and will be watched.

* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and
  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be 
  tolerated.

* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor 
  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.

~

0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
 
0 HEALER~
The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~ 


-1 GAIN~
The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain apply :  turns 10 skill points into one practice 

Gain uses practices to gain new skills, spell groups, and kits.
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~

52 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~


0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~
0 'SKILL POINTS'~
Skill Points are rewarded to you for using your various skills in a 
combat situation.  You cannot "spam up" a skill and get skill points.
You need to actually get out and do stuff.

0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT FULLSAC~
MHS uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat
fullsac   : able to sacrifice containers with items inside

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it.

-1 CLAN CLANS~
Throughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common
cause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the
spread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.

In order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,
either by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name
of their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4
beside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as
follows:

You must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast
of any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either
joined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.

Once you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If
for some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you
must first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must
purchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. 
Also, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find 
themselves clanless quickly.

Expect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your
life miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said
there must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some
one makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of
the game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?
Find better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play. The larger
the player base grows the more fun you'll have and the more targets you'll
have. 

See HELP CLIST for a list of currently active clans on MHS, and a brief
description of the purpose of each clan.

0  SUMMONER 'SUMMON ELEMENTAL'~
This spell allows the elementalist to open a gateway to one of the 
Elemental Planes.  Through this gatewy, the elementalist calls a creature
to do his bidding.  The exact type of elemental summoned is completely
random.  It is said that the elementals from the Planes of Spirit and Energy 
grant special powers to those that summon them.
~
0 NATURE FRIEND~
A Druid with this kit is the ultimate friend of nature.  They are able to
use the charm animal spell to easily charm members of the animal kingdom.
They can also call forth a swarm to come to their aid.

See Also:  charm animal, swarm
~
0 CHARM ANIMAL~
     Syntax: cast 'charm animal' <target>

The charm animal is nothing like the charm person spell.  It can only be
cast on animals.  Some mobs are animals, and some mobs are not animals.
The number of animals a Druid can control is based on their level.
~
0 SWARM~
     Syntax: cast swarm <target>

     Rats, Locusts, Ants, Butterflies, Wasps, Fireflys.

0 KNIGHT~
Individuals who have  studied the art of mounted combat are the Knights
in Boinga.  They must rely on their strength and constitution in order to
endure the long hours of Knight school.

Knights have the unique ability to call forth a warhorse using the 
{Ccall mount{x spell.  Even the larger races, who are unable to ride current
mounts, can ride their magestic warhorses.  The warhorse's time on this 
world is limited.

Knights also have the ability to charge their opponents with the {Ckcharge{x 
skill.  The kcharge attack can only be used to initiate combat, as it is
very difficult to do a charge in melee. 

Knights from the warrior or blademaster classes must wield a polearm
in order to kcharge.  Knights from the cleric or paladin classes must wield
a flail in order to kcharge.

NOTE:  The riding skill is *NOT* included in the Knight kit.  In order to
       use your warhorse with any proficiency, you must take this skill
       in addition to the knight kit.
       {YALSO!!!{x
       Knights are no longer given the polearm and flail skills they require
       to do the kcharge attack depending on your class.  There are now
       pre-reqs for Knight-School.

to trust your gut instinct.

These are the vnums to use for adding branch clan halls to the game
boogums

Roaming Guard Mobs.  Here is how it works.  Each clan hall area and 
branch hall area should have/get a copy of the existing guard mob.
hte only difference is, you remove the sentinal flag from the mob.
you also need to add the stay_area flag as well.  The name of the 
mob should be changed to 'roaming blah blah blah' so for Demise it
woudl be 'roaming guard of cthon' or something like that.  that way
we can find them easily.  For roamers in the branch halls, use the 
branch hall area.  Let's try an minimize cross vnumming.  Post
up any questions to me.

0 'BRANCH HALLS'~
Branch Clan halls

Initial room, guard, and discription - free

Your guard corps start out as entry level.  You may pay for 
training for your entire guard corps.  This training includes 
all guards on staff at your branch hall. Should decide to hire more 
guards, they will have the same level of training and ability 
as your existing corps.   Prices for training your guards or 
hiring new guards are found in the {YPRICES{x helpfile.

Clan leaders are responsible for the descriptions of the equipment, 
however stats and affects of the equipment has been predetermined 
and will be the same for all clans.  This is not negotiable or 
upgrade-able.  

You may have a maximum of 2 guards per room.

A Guard Eq set consists of a helmet, a shield, gloves, a torso item,
and boots.  

Branch offices will be open to all clanners, that is
why you have a guard, who will sound the alarm should an
enemy invade your branch hall.

You will be provided one (1) one way door into your branch
clan hall from the portal room of your Main hall.  To return 
to your main hall, you will have to use your traditional 
means of transportation.  The branch halls are nowhere, 
meaning people scanning from outside your hall cannot see you. 
However, you will not be able to use scan from inside your 
branch hall.  You will have to go outside. The entrance to 
your branch hall is a secret entrance.    

Clan leaders can purchase upgrades and additions for their 
branch hall, but remember, all clanners can get into your 
alls and have access to anything in there, so build wisely.
Prices for additions to your branch halls are the same as
those in the "help prices" file.  Branch halls may not have 
portals or obs rooms.  Branch halls may not have locking doors, 
private rooms, owner only, or clan specific only rooms.  
Every room in a branch hall will be open to all clanners.

Portals are NO LONGER AVAILABLE you may put a branch hall in an area of your
choosing.

Immortals:
See the help BHALLS file for vnums.

0 DOT 'DAMAGE OVER TIME'~

Damage Over Time (also called DOT) affects are special types of spell affects.
A DOT affect doesn't cycle with normal spell affects, it has its own timer
and is not looked at during normal ticks.  DOTs use a special, faster tick
that kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,
doing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but
this isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low
amounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this
very reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of
damage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can
use several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes 
and do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage
a DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.

The Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT
spells in the 'disease' group.  No DOT can rival the power of these spells.
Other, more mundane DOT spells exist.
