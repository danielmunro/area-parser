Top of the Temple~
You have reached the pinnacle of the Pyramid of the Sun. The 
view from here is incredible!!! The sun beats down upon you 
mercilessly from high. There is an altar here, covered with 
offerings of exotic flowers and golden idols. A steep 
staircase descends into the cool darkness of the pyramid.

Sacrificial Altar~
As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you notice a macabre 
sight before you. A grotesque altar lies before you. Its 
surface is carved with channels which, at first glance, 
appear to be filled with water, but further examination shows 
it to be blood. A small sign by the drain says, "To fountain 
in the Hall of the Clan of Demise. ".
