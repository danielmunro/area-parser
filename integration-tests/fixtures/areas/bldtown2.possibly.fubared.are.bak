An Open Letter to the Citizens of Boinga.

My name is Taeriad, a sage from a distant land.  I have come here to prevent
a disaster.  I hope that with your help, the destruction of our world can be
prevented.

My research lies primarily in the area of the five elements.  Each of Fire
Water, Air, Earth, and Spirit have much to offer in the way of gifts of
knowledge and power.  I have made it my life's quest to learn as much
as is possible about each of the elements.  Through my research, I often
communicated directly with powerful spirits from the elemental planes.  It
was through one of these communications that I inadvertantly learned of
a threat to our
