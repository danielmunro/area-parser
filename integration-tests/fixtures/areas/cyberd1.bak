A man is here waiting to tear your ticket.

This guy looks as though he's bored out of his skull.  He doesn't

Hiding in the corner, a kid is trying to sneak into the theatre.
~
This teenager isn't old enough to be going to this play so he's
trying to sneak in.  He probably doesn't have the money for a ticket
either.  Hopefully the ticket clerk will notice him.

All this guy seems to know how to say is "please get your feet down,"
and "don't talk so loud."  He seems to know how to ush pretty good but

Not much is known about this man.  It is said he's worked at the
theatre sometime in the past and has been here ever since.  No-one can
seem to remember if he was an actor or an employee.  One thing is
certain, however.  He is not content to stay in the shadows.

seriously.  Not one to skip a meal or a snack, Mae eats constantly,

Bruce the vain~
Muttering to himself, the conceited man is oblivious to you.
~
Bruce has a lot of problems.  Most of them stem from the fact that
he is totally in love with himself.  Unfortunately he's the only one.
He feels he was put into this world just so that everyone else would
have something nice to look at.  Actually he was put into the world
because of a sick joke.

lynched by the audience.

He came to work today planning on sweeping the floors.  The manager
had other ideas.  The janitor has never acted a day in his life and it
shows.  He hasn't made it through a single paragraph without making a
mistake.  Nervous and just a bit scared, his voice cracks as he does
his best to finish the play.

Hanging on the chandelier~
You step through a hidden doorway and walk for several minutes along
a dusty twisting hall.  Climbing steadily you finally emerge in a very
small room above the chandelier.  From up here you can see the auditorium
and stage.  The door behind you slams shut leaving you with only one 
direction, down.

next few months.  There is a small display filled with pictures of actors
and playwrights that have performed here.  The aura of the theatre calls

The farther inside you go the more the aroma in the air makes your
stomach growl.  Looking around at your surroundings, you find yourself
in a beautifully designed lobby.  Red-painted walls are covered in
drapes that frame many more posters.  On the floor is a tasteful rose-
print carpet.  To the north you can see the source of the tantalizing
odor, while to the south is the entrance.

Walking up to the counter you see all kinds of candy inside the glass.
Mounted to one side of the counter is a large machine full of popped
popcorn.  Just the sight of it makes your mouth water.  On the counter's
other side is a soda fountain.  Hanging on the wall behind everything 
is a large sign displaying the items and prices.  A concession worker
stands nearby waiting for you to purchase something.

The west auditorium entrance~
As you enter this small hallway you notice a door to the west marked
"Manager".  The sound of popcorn popping can be heard to the east.  You
can also barely hear the voices of the actors filtering through the door
to the north.  A staircase leads up to the balcony.

The Manager's office~
Upon entering the room you slowly become aware that you should have
knocked first.  You look around and see several old filing cabinets,
probably containing income and inventory reports.  A large desk is
situated against the wall and is covered with a mass of papers.  On 
top of the papers there sits a large open money box.

pretty inviting.  People with good sight and hearing love to sit here
but many don't like to have to look around other people's heads.  Perhaps
you would prefer to sit closer?

As you continue down the asile it gets easier to see and hear the play.
It is obviously a one man version of Hamlet.  Most of the words are

In the middle~
The middle of the auditorium is perhaps the most popular section of
the theatre.  Close enough to see and hear the play but far enough back
to allow a person to take in the entire stage.  The actor onstage seems
to be rather unsure of his lines which prompts you to begin asking your-
self if this was such a good idea after all.  Maybe you might get your
money's worth sitting down front so you could have a better laugh.

In the aisle~
As you continue down the asile it gets easier to see and hear the play.
It is obviously a one man version of Hamlet.  Most of the words are
comprehensible but the actor seems to be stumbling through some of his
lines.

The Janitor's closet~
What was obviously once a cleaning closet has been changed into
someone's dressing room.  A small mirror hass been absently nailed to
the wall while a small stand covered in stage-makeup bottles and cleaning
supplies has been shoved in the corner.  You wonder how anyone could
have managed to change clothes in a room this small.

A small room~
Finding yourself in a small room just off the auditorium you notice
very little.  Except for a large portion of wall covered in graffiti
of a rather questionable nature nothing else grabs your eye.  To the
east you can still see Hamlet giving the performance of his life
(possibly his last).  There is also a door leading north.

In the aisle~
You have walked all the way to the front of the auditorium.  You can

you the orchestra is taking a small break.  Why don't you find a seat
and have a good laugh at the actor's expense?

Down front~
Now that you have reached the front of the theatre you can plainly
see that this actor does not have a very good grasp of Shakespeare.
"To be or not to be, what was the question?" he says quietly.  Hamlet
was meant to be a tragedy, not a comedy.  The only tragedy around here
is his acting.  He does happen to have one thing going for him, however.
Perserverance.  If you didn't buy any popcorn, now would be a good time.

Mae's dressing room~
This dressing room belongs to Mae, the singer.  She has been here
performing for several years.  Flowers from her many admirers fill
nearly one-quarter of the room.  Another quarter is taken up by a very
large wardrobe.  A huge wall length mirror dominates the north wall and
its edges are covered by pictures of Mae's friends and relatives.  The
final portion of the room is taken up by Mae, herself.  A rather large
valkyrie warrior costume is hanging on the door of the wardrobe.

At this end of the hall you see three doors.  The one to the north
has a large star on it.  Through it you can hear someone throwing a
tantrum.  From the east you can hear another person singing.  Her voice
seems rather loud but is almost in key.  A small door to the south has
a small plaque which reads "Janitor".  The hallway continues to the west.

The orchestra players have decided to take a break.  Or rather they
tried to break each other.  Pieces of instruments and torn sheet music
litter the floor.  What was once a chair and parts of a music stand
indicate that nothing was spared.  What could have started all this, you
ask yourself.

Bruce's dressing room~
If you could sum up this room into one word, that word would have to
be "vain".  Pictures of Bruce are everywhere.  Some large, some small,
most of them are autographed by Bruce, himself.  It doesn't look as
though he's been performing here long as most of his possessions are
still stuffed into his suitcases.  His makeup table is conspicuously
empty except for a solitary piece of paper.

The back exit~
Just inside the rear entrance you watch the people going about their
work.  With everyone bustling about you try to keep out of the way as
much as possible.  Hanging hap-hazzardly on some nearby hooks are the
coats of the employees.  A time clock slowly ticks the seconds away.
The exit to the north will lead you out of the theatre while to the
west might get you run down by a busy stagehand.

The bustling around you grates on your nerves as you get jostled back

bump into you time and again.  Someone shouts "hey, buddy, get outta
the way, would ya?"  Most of the people are rushing to the stage door
to the north while some are trying to get to the dressing rooms to the
south.  The rear exit can be seen to the east.

The crowd is really getting ugly now.  Hamlet has just reached the
middle of the play and the audience doesn't look like it can take
anymore.  "A lass for Yorick, I knew him when, Horatio?" he intones
meekly.  As you glance at the people they stare blankly back at you.
If you don't stop him, they may turn on the both of you.

Standing underneath a small light you can barely see anything.  The
alley here is very dark but you see trash piled up everywhere.  Strange
pictures and graffiti cover the brick walls and are so numerous that
you can't make out anything.  The alleyway leads north but you should
be on your guard.  The light overhead can't reach into the blackness
that reaches for you.

As you near the stage entrance you have this uncontrollable urge to
be as quiet as possible.  It might be your common sense telling you this
or it could be the sign on the wall.  In any case you do your best.
Stagehands and actors speed along moving in both directions and on
several occasions nearly collide.  You decide you'd hate to be around
when they finally have an accident.

Here is where all the scenery is created.  There are several

on various shelves.  It's a good thing no-one is trying to construct
anything as there is a play going on.  On the other hand, given the way
the crowd is recieving it, perhaps a distraction wouldn't be much of a
bad thing.

Judging from your surroundings you decide you've ended up in the prop
department.  Everything from fake swords to fake food can be found here.
Costumes and fake jewelry are also stored in this room.  Roman, Greek, 
Renaissance, and other types of dress have been created by some very
talented seamstresses.  One of the more interesting of all the props is
an iron maiden set against the wall.  You wonder if there are any spikes
in it.

in search of one more morsel of food.  To the east you can see the dump
as the wind blows the foul air towards you.  The alley continues west
and as the buildings lean closer toward each other the light from above
gradually dims.

Deep in the heart of the catacombs you find it.  This room is the home
of the mysterious figure known as the Phantom.  It's covered in pictures
and etchings of some of the most glamorous actresses that have graced the
theater with their presence.  Stage props, scripts, and papers are strewn
about the place.  Dominating the entire north wall is a giant pipe organ.
The largest of the pipes reaches almost to the top of the ceiling 30 feet
off of the floor.  The eerie music you have been hearing originates from
it and is reaching a fevered pitch.
