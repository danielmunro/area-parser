A Faerie Garden~
An abundance of flora thrives here. The scent is pleasant, and your eyes are
even more pleased than your nose. A brilliant palette of flowers grow 
everywhere: irises, petunias, magnolias, dahlias, tiger lilies, you name it.

The path is still fairly faint on the ground, but its edges are clearly

flowers and your skin, making you feel at peace. Small creatures skitter 
about happily in this magical garden.

a lot of possessions or furniture. You suspect it's because squirrels or 
birds steal them.

happiest moments of their lives. Pretty soon there will be even more little

Hm, this family happens to have a taste for oak wood. There's an oak table,
oak chairs, oak headboards, oak cabinets... far more furniture than any
faerie could ever need or want, but perhaps someone here takes a hobby to
wood-carving. A faerie could carve out splendid furniture for an entire
family with only half a branch.

This home is completely barren. Perhaps the inhabitants have moved out, or
passed away, but all that is left here is the skeleton of an empty bed. On
one side of the house, there are twigs and bits of string accumulating, as 
if a bird is trying to build its nest here.

there since creation. The walls are pure white, and the trimmings are of a
pale blue. You can see some faeries flying to and from the castle, their
fluttering wings shining in the sunlight. It seems to be a friendly place,
a welcoming one to any and all visitors.

upon their furniture like the faeries here could, you would most likely

preparing some kind of meat. With lots of people to feed, the kitchen is

is the Faerie Queen, a beautiful creature with enchanting eyes. This is her

spends her days here in the glistening throne room while she deals with
both important and mundane matters. For now, the castle and her little glen
