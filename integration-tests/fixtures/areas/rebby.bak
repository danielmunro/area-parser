Baby New Year~
Baby New Year is here, smoking a cigar.
~
You are alarmed to see a fresh-cheeked baby so obviously evil.  He is
grinning cunningly at you as he gauges your condition, determining exactly
what it will take to kill you.  As he reaches into his diaper for his
weapon (ewwww), he shouts a greeting:  "Hiya, hiya, Schmuck!  Happy
ROFLin' New Year!

Middle-Aged Year~
Middle-Aged Year is here, ready to go jogging.
~
Dressed in a jogging outfit, it looks as though the Year has grown up
quite a lot from his evil baby days.  He glances at you impatiently,
obviously in a hurry to go on his run.  If you don't leave soon, he might
just kill you for wasting his time.

Entrance to the Plane of Time.  Please read the sign.~
You are walking in the air through a sort of mist through which you can barely
see your hand in front of your face.  You have a vague feeling that north is
the correct way to proceed, but you are completely overwhelmed by the idea that
you should do a 'read sign' first.

At the Pendulum~
You note with interest that what appears to be a huge, wooden pendulum
is swinging before you.  As you look up, you see a gigantic cuckoo clock,
surely large enough for a giant to enter, and at least three stories
high| You are confident that if you are quick, you can catch hold
of the swinging pendulum and climb up to the entrance that you see at the
base of the clock.

Inside the Clock's Entrance~
As you stand at the lip of the entrance, you stagger a bit, still dizzy
from the experience.  There is a sign on the ceiling - you suppose because
it was meant to be read on the climb up.  Before you, to the north, is a
wooden door.  Openings to the east and west look dark and forbidding.

absolutely nothing remarkable about these halls - slate grey paint, no

Sunday's Room~
A mural of a rainy Sunday afternoon has been beautifully painted here,
a vista through a window pane from a cozy, bright room.  The drizzle
outdoors on the duck pond, blackening the trees with its wetness, is in
sharp contrast to the comfortable feeling inside the room.  You wonder
where the fireplace is, you feel it so strongly...

in one place except in an actual toy store.  You see a set of drums
in one corner, a TV and VCR in another, a paint set in a third, and
a chair in the fourth, where Monday Blahs may or may not be found,
depending upon whether he's managed to cheer himself up or not.

Summer's Area~
It appears you have found yourself a beautiful summer afternoon, the
shadows just beginning to lengthen.  A gentle breeze brings the smell
of freshly-mown grass to your nostrils and the low buzz of bees somes
from those bushes over there.  The trees in the grove that surrounds
you are in full and glorious leaf.

Autumn's Area~
You have stepped into a picture-perfect autumn morning, the sun shining
brightly, white clouds floating mildly in the blue sky.  A brisk and
cool breeze occasionally causes the grass to ripple at your feet.  The
trees in the grove that surrounds you sport spectacularly orange and
red and golden leaves.

of the cuckoo's roost.  There seems to be a "path" up the face of the

Shielding your eyes as best you can from the brilliant, bright light that
you find yourself in, you can still make out which directions you can take.
If you go up, prepare for worse.

In a blinding light!~
The pain in your eyes is nearly unbearable as you squint and try to
shield them.  You can barely see.  It appears that if you go down, the
brilliance will lessen.

Month of Sundays' Room~
On the wall you see a calendar for the current month showing 30 Sundays
straight down in a column, each one marked "Weekly Meeting" in red crayon.
You see a closet in one wall with at least a score of well-tailored suits,
all clearly marked "Sunday Best".

End of the hallway~
Walking carefully on the polished floor, you are at the west end of this
hallway.  No place to go but east, you study the many portraits and the
tapestries with admiration.

See through Time~
This room seems to veer your vision upwards and forces 
your mind to have the ability to see all planes of time.
you see psychadelic colors slowly move in from left to 
right. As you scan the planes, these colors meld 
together into a form which you can recognize if you 
concentrate enough. You feel that if you stand here 
much longer, your head will go numb of asphixiation.
