The Grand Gate of Thalos~
You stand in the archway of a gigantic stone archway. The two
steel gates have been forced open and have rusted in place. A hollow
gust of wind blows by you into the deserted, and seemingly destroyed,
city.

This was once a magnificent street, but now is in total ruin. The

side is a collapsed house while on the other is the entrance to a large
ruined mansion. Eerie sounds echo within the mansion. Near the center of
town you see a large domed building, relatively intact.

A glorious place in it's prime, this tavern now lies in ruin; tables
and chairs are broken scattered, bottles and glasses shattered, and
a small performance stage crushed. Musical instruments and personal
belongings lie under the rubble, but the people they once belonged to are
not with them. Looking up you see that the entire second floor and roof
has fallen in, leaving a gaping hole above.

A few chairs have survived, as well as a large curved desk. To the east
is a vine-covered archway leading out into a private courtyard.

Hallways lead south and east.

What a shame that this mass destruction also touched this once
beautiful place. The temple's garden path has nothing on this garden.
Flowers and trees have been smashed into the ground and lawn benches
thrown through walls. A large marble fountain in the center of the
courtyard still stands, though, defying any attempts to destroy its
beauty. Above stands the remnants of one of the watchtowers. Archways
north and west lead back into the city hall.

entrance into another building through yet another collapsed wall.
Between the two buildings are a few blast craters and boulders. An old

steamy water still wells up from a hole in the floor. Obviously there
is a hot spring located under the city (making the decision to put
a city here seem much more reasonable). Closer inspection of the water
yields a dead body floating around in it, skin melted away from months
of floating in there. The west wall has collapsed revealing another
collapsed house.

Unfortunately, it succumbed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desecrated. Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tongue.
     Wind gusts through the four archways and howls and screams can be
heard from all parts of the city.
