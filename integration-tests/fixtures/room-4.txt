***REUSE THIS ROOM FIRST***~
You are on the top floor of the tower of observation.  A final series of
observation points are available to you.  You hear a rumbling from the floors
beneath you!  Ugh!  Is one of them after you?  Better make your stay a short
one!  Remember that the tower itself is not a friendly place, it too holds
some secrets that you may not be aware of!
The tower runs downwards to the second floor from here.
